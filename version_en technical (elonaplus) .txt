===2.20: detailed changelog===
 [New items]
* deed of camp
** Shops may sell these. Reading it on the world map builds a camp. Make your dream camp a reality!

* float cage
** Does not spawn randomly. The Camp starts out with 6 of these placed in it.
** NPCs that can be dominated can be captured with one of these when their HP is less than 25% of maximum.
** Greatly decreases the target's Impress and master/servant score.
** NPCs that have been captured with this can be brought off the map as they are. They will use a pet slot like an escort NPC.
** A float cage bit flag will be applied to the target that makes them unable to move and reduces the damage they take by half.
** The options available when 'i'nteracting with them are limited just like for escort quest NPCs.
** When they are made to wait in town or die and revive, they will still remain caged.
** NPCs are not useful in this state, so you will need to bring them to the Camp to put them to work.
** The requirements for using this are not as strict as monster balls which require targets to be lower than 10% HP and also have a level restriction. However, getting NPCs captured with a float cage to become a pet is more involved - the main use of NPCs caught this way is for labour.

* slave spinner
** Does not spawn randomly. The camp starts out with 1 placed in it. Can be used only in a Camp.
** Causes 20 auto-turns if the player character uses it, yielding 3 Toil-Energy per turn but costs 5 SP per turn.
** This shares the "You are bored" cooldown with training machines.

* slave wheel
** Does not spawn randomly. The camp starts out with 2 of these placed in it. Can be used only in a Camp.
** Causes 60 auto-turns if the player character uses it, yielding 1 Toil-Energy per turn but costs 2 SP per turn.
** This shares the "You are bored" cooldown with training machines.

* Inmate Correction Manual
** A red book that does not spawn randomly. The camp starts out with 1 placed in it.
** I wrote and rewrote this to get the tone right and before I knew it, it was like this.
** But this might par for the course for the people of Irva?

 [New player-owned property]
* Camp
** Looks just like the Prison on the world map. Up to 100 items can be placed in it. Maintenance fees are 2,500gp per month.
** Aside from the abovementioned new items, it will also have some items that are difficult to obtain like the guillotine, iron maiden, and giant's shackle.
** House boards and similar items will offer the following options:

* Removed from cage
** Shows the list of NPCs with the float cage bit flag. Selecting an NPC will remove the bit flag from it and place a float cage on that spot.
** This means that float cages are reusable unlike monster balls.
** The selected NPC gets removed from the list of pets and gets an interned bit flag. Up to 30 NPCs can be interned at the camp at a time.
** Unlike the Discarded Ranch, NPCs who die will not revive.

* Move a inmate
** Works just like moving a stayer in your home.

* Change Toil-Lv 
** Can be set anywhere from 0 to 3.

* Exchange Toil-Energy 
** Trade Toil-Energy for various items in a list. The exchange rate and items available are subject to change.
** Every 72 hours, you will receive Toil-Energy upon entering the map. The amount received depends on the Toil-Lv and the master/servant score of each interned NPC.
** The Life of every interned NPC is reduced by the Toil-Lv cubed. NPCs whose Life is 0 or less will die.
** There is no Life reduction if Toil-Lv is set to 0.
** The amount of Toil-Energy received from master/servant score is independent of Toil-Lv.
** The attributes of NPCs do not matter, so whether you want to treat them as disposable or keep the Toil-Lv at 0 and raise the master/servant score, you should prioritize filling the Camp first for greatest efficiency.
** Unlike yaca points, every Camp has a separate Toil-Energy value.
** Up to 100,000 Toil-Energy can be accumulated per Camp.

* Added a few options for the conversation window for interned NPCs (see below).
** Their regular lines will be different if master/servant score is below 100.

* <Darkness evochat>
** Unimplemented because the exact details haven't been ironed out yet.
** In general it should be like evochat but you do terrible things to raise their master/servant score.

* I have decided to release you.
** If master/servant is 150 or greater, they join you as a pet.
** If master/servant is less than 150 and Impress is below 100, they turn hostile and attack you.
** Otherwise, they will just disappear.

* I have decided to execute you as a demonstration.
** Kills them instantly.
** All interned NPCs including those out of visual range will have their master/servant score increased, but their Impress decreased.
** The lower their master/servant score, the higher the chance they will be afflicted by Fear.

 [New special action]
* God charge Rod
** Procs when zapping a rod and expends 100% of the power gauge.
** Has the usual gauge attack effects. This is actually the same as the Casting gauge attack asides from the following additional effect:
** Gives +10 recharge power if used by an allied character.

 [Elean band encounter]
* They demand less gold than rogue attacks.
* Picking any option other than "I will donate as you said" will cause them to attack.
* The initial verbal exchange is written to seem preposterous.
* You get to experience what it's like to be on the receiving end of violent rhetoric - with extra emphasis on the 'violent' part.
* It's easy to just get angry or exasperated or dismissive, but when you are put on the spot, will you be able to point out where exactly the flaws in their logic are?
* Moral of the story: it's important for everybody (yourself and myself included) to not accidentally have double standards/engage in hypocrisy and prejudice/believe everything you hear.

 [New NPCs]
* anabolic resistance
** Level 115 bacteria. Unlike most meshera, eating it does not cause pregnancy.
** Will not do anything when health is low.
** Uses Eye of Insanity, Squeeze, and Melt Clinch.

* monster bacteria

 ===2.19: detailed changelog===
 [About the new evochat options]
* Selecting <Mind unlock> brings up the following options.
** The success rate increases with as (player character Lock Picking + target Lock Picking + Impress or master-servant relation) increases.
** (Success rate is capped at 90% for medium difficulty options, and capped at 80% for high difficulty options).
** Evochat action points will decrease by 1 upon selecting the option, whether it fails or not.
** Unlocking any of these relationships will raise the maximum Impress and master-servant relation attainable, up to a maximum of 999 depending on the player's Lock Picking + target's Lock Picking.
** If the success rate is too low, you may want to train up Lock Picking for both parties or pick an easy route first and increase maximum Impress with that one. After all, if you want to get anywhere with a relationship, starting as friends is a tried-and-true strategy.

* (Impress-type relationship. Unlock difficulty: Low) Fight together as allies. Initiates the Comrade route.

* (Impress-type relationship. Unlock difficulty: Low) Let's be friends. Initiates the Friend route.

* (Impress-type relationship. Unlock difficulty: Low) I want to compete with you. Initiates the Rival route.

* (Impress-type relationship. Unlock difficulty: Medium) I'm in love with you. Initiates the Affection route.

* (Impress-type relationship. Unlock difficulty: Medium) I want you to teach me various things. Initiates the Student route.

* (Impress-type relationship. Unlock difficulty: High) I want to lead you. Initiates the Master route.

* (Impress-type relationship. Unlock difficulty: High) I think of you as an important family member. Initiates the Family route.

* (Master-servant-type relationship. Unlock difficulty: Low) I want to make a contract with you. Initiates the Contract route.

* (Master-servant-type relationship. Unlock difficulty: Medium) You are my pet! Initiates the Owner route.

* (Master-servant-type relationship. Unlock difficulty: High) I want you to pledge allegiance to me. Initiates the Loyalty route.

* (Unlock difficulty: Medium) <I want to be your help...>
** Help them with whatever is troubling them, raising the lower limit of their power gauge by 1.
** Unlocking this will remove it from the list of options.
** Will be reset by Maile when selecting the Relationship with ally option.

* (Unlock difficulty: High) <Show the real you...>
** Open a can of worms. InSANity lower limit gets raised to 10, power gauge lower limit gets permanently raised by 5.
** Unlocking this will remove it from the list of options.
** Will be reset by Maile when selecting the Relationship with ally option.

 [About the relationship routes]
* Only the most recently-selected route has an effect. Don't you just love it when you thought you were just friends, but turns out it was love?
** Will be reset by Maile when selecting the Relationship with ally option.
** These should pretty much cover everything, but detailed suggestions for improvements are welcome. (I can't add too many options though because the conversation window is already full enough as it is.)
** All of the routes are the same at low Impress (Hate, Annoying, etc) because that's probably an accurate representation of what they feel.

* Comrade route
** Trust -> Ally -> Comrade -> BattleBond
** This is basically the option to make progress while retaining the default Impress type of relationship.

* Friend route
** Friend -> Fellow -> Sworn Mate -> Soul Mate

* Rival route
** Competitor -> Rival -> *Rival* -> Fateful

* Affection route
** Affection -> Mutual -> Passionate -> Love

* Student route
** Student -> Successor -> Comparable -> *Disciple*

* Master route
** Teacher -> Master -> Respect -> LifeMaster

* Family route
** Family -> Dear -> Doting -> MatureLove

* Contract route
** Contract -> *Contract* -> Partner -> Co-Fate

* Owner route
** Amenable -> Owner -> Subjection -> Reliance
** This is basically the option to make progress while retaining the default master-servant type of relationship.

* Loyalty route
** Allegiance -> Obedience -> Adoration -> Loyalty

 [New random events]
* Premonition of big catch
** Occurs on coastal maps on the tiles with the fish icon.
** Instantly receive 8 to 13 fish items.
** Receive 16 to 26 instead if you are on a fishing ship.
** The fish goes directly into your inventory, and will fail if there isn't enough space.
** The type of fish received depends on which coastal map you are on:
** Kapul coastal: seabream or manboo
** Lumiest coastal: salmon or sardine
** Devil coastal: sandborer or flatfish
** Valm coastal: moonfish or globefish
** Kurualm coastal: tuna or cutlassfish
** You know how shops were selling fish that were unobtainable from fishing? Let's just say this is where they were coming from - caught out in the open ocean.

* Shadow of a Ship
** Occurs on coastal maps on the tiles with the ship icon.
** Upon approaching it, if it is a merchant ship, it will behave just like a wandering vendor - you can buy and sell from them. The shop rank and strength of the NPC escorts work just like wandering vendors, but the types of items sold will resemble that of general vendors and it will have 10 times as much stock for every item.
** There is a Cargo Wt-dependent chance that you will encounter a Pirate ship instead. The encounter chance is independent of player character level. The enemy strength is the same as a rogue encounter, but there is only 1 type of pirate trash mob that will spawn. Stats-wise, <the pirate captain> is the same as a rogue boss.
** If your ship is a pirate ship, warship, or submarine, you can launch a preemptive strike before making contact.
** If the target is a merchant ship, they will flee.
** If the target is a pirate ship, their ship durability will be decreased by 1.
** There is a chance that the target's ship may start the battle with Minor damage even if you didn't use a preemptive strike on them.

** Ram your ship: chance of failing increases with target ship durability.
** Failing it will decrease both your ship's and the target's durability by 1. Ramming is guaranteed to succeed if the target is a merchant ship.
** Cannot be used if your own ship is About to sink. Upon success, you will board the target's ship and engage in combat with enemy NPCs.
** When target ship durability reaches 0, the event concludes.
** Sinking a pirate ship gives a fixed 1,000 fame.

** Attack from a distance: cannot be selected unless your ship is a pirate ship, warship, or submarine.
** If the target is a pirate ship, their durability will decrease by 1. There is a 50% chance they will counterattack, decreasing your ship durability by 1.
** This option cannot be selected if the target is a pirate ship and your ship is About to sink.
** When target ship durability reaches 0, it sinks and the event concludes. Merchant ships sink in 1 hit.
** Sinking a pirate ship gives a fixed 1,000 fame. Sinking a merchant ship gives -10 karma.
** You may have already noticed, but there is no point in sinking merchant ships, and you can't loot them if they're at the bottom of the ocean.

** Run away: only available if the target is a pirate ship. Decrease your ship durability by 1 and concludes the event.
** If it is already About to sink, durability will not be decreased, but fame will decrease instead.

 [New items]
* scroll of harvest
** Has a low chance of spawning randomly.
** Has the same effect as the harvest spell.

* scroll of attract
** Spawns randomly.
** Brings 3 random enemies on the current map and places them next to you. Can be used like Dimensional Fishing except that this does not require Fishing skill.

* high potion of agony
** Can be crafted with item fusion, and can be thrown by potion-throwing NPCs.
** Will attempt to apply Sleep, Poisoned, Paralyzed, Confused, and Blinded.
** Potency increases proportionally with [danger level of current map] but at about half the rate compared to that of a high potion of disaster.
** NB: "clear liquid" when unidentified. Japanese term when unidentified translates to "pain-bringing potion".

* high potion of calamity
** Can be crafted with item fusion, and can be thrown by potion-throwing NPCs.
** Will attempt to apply Element Scar, Nightmare, Mist of Frailness, Slow, and Mist of Silence.
** The number of turns all of these debuffs will last for is set to the debuff that lasts the shortest amount of time (i.e. Mist of Silence).
** Potency and length of debuff increase proportionally with [danger level of current map].
** NB: "clear liquid" when unidentified. Japanese term when unidentified translates to "curse-bringing potion".

* high potion of physical
** Can be crafted with item fusion. Does not spawn randomly.
** Applies Holy Shield, Regeneration, Speed, and Feather at the same time, but the potency is less than what it would have been if the buffs were individually applied.
** NB: "clear liquid" when unidentified. Japanese term when unidentified translates to "cutting-edge potion".

 [Revamped potion throwing skill repertoire]
* Minor potion throwing: potion of blindness, potion of confusion, potion of paralysis, poison, sleeping drug, and high potion of calamity.
* Potion throwing: potions of slow, silence, weaken resistance, weakness, and high potion of agony. It's just not the same without the fire pillars from the molotovs, but it should be more practical to use now.
* Greater potion throwing: bottle of sulfuric, love potion, gasoline, high potion of calamity, high potion of agony, and high potion of aqua sanctio.


===2.18R: detailed changelog===

 ===2.18: detailed changelog===

 [Coastal maps]
* Works like a type of world map.
** Dying here will take you to the Return point on the previous world map.
** Like other world maps, 1 tile equals 1 mile, but travelling is slower here than on other world maps.
** No structures such as shelters or deed buildings may be built on the Sea map.
** Treasure maps cannot be read as they would be impossible to dig up.
** Pressing the enter key on the surface brings you to the Seabed map.
** To get back to the previous map, step on the mooring point. This is the tile that has an anchor symbol on it - you also get placed next to this tile when entering the coastal map.
** If your boat sinks, you will have to swim. While swimming, every character will lose 1 SP per turn. They will also have the Wet status applied, and have a low Swimming skill-dependent chance of gaining additional Dyspnea on top of the Dypsnea they already have.
** It may snow, but snow will not slow your movement speed.
** The map has nothing on it and you will not have any random encounter battles for now.
** Only some of the existing random events from previous versions of the game will occur while on the map.
** The new random events (see below) will change the boat's status as follows:
** No problems -> Minor damage -> Many troubles -> Dangerous -> About to sink -> Unnavigable
** Once the boat is Unnavigable it can no longer be used to move around.
** When the boat becomes Unnavigable or is currently Unnavigable, Wet status and 10 turns of Dyspnea is applied to all characters.

 [New random events]
* Raging Sea
** Occurs when the weather is Hard rain or Etherwind, or may occur after some time.
** The higher the ship's rank, the less frequently this event occurs.
** The event cannot be negated with an aurora ring.
** The [image] will change slightly if the weather is Hard rain or Etherwind.

* The following events will occur only while riding on a boat.
** For the first three events, certain options will not show up if you do not meet the prerequisites for them. (e.g. If you do not have space for more people/if you don't have the necessary items.)
** So if you don't want to get a Karma penalty, make sure your boat isn't full and that you have the needed items on hand.

* Swept Away
** (Abandon): Karma -1
** (Put on your ship): Drifter +1
** (Throw 1 inner tube and leave): Lose 1 inner tube (cargo item)

* After Escape
** (Abandon): Karma -1
** (Put on your ship): Drifter +1
** (Throw 1 traveler's food and leave): Lose 1 traveler's food (cargo item)

* Drifters
** (Abandon collectively): Karma -3 to -10
** (Put on your ship as much as you can): Drifters +3 to +10, capped by capacity
** (Throw 1 inner tube and leave): Lose 1 inner tube (cargo item)

* Aerial Threat
** Won't occur at all when using the submarine.
** Choosing to run away will roll a number dependent on the ship rank. If the roll fails, the ship's condition deteriorates by 1 rank.
** Choosing to fight will cause no damage to pirate ships and warships. For other types of ship, the ship's condition will deteriorate by 1 rank.

* Undersea Threat
** Choosing to run away will roll a number dependent on the ship rank. If the roll fails, the ship's condition deteriorates by 1 rank.
** Choosing to fight will cause no damage to warships and submarines. For other types of ship, the ship's condition will deteriorate by 1 rank.

* Ship capacity:
** huge raft - up to 2 drifters
** fishing ship - up to 5 drifters
** pirate ship - up to 10 drifters
** cruise ship - up to 100 drifters
** warship - up to 20 drifters
** submarine - up to 5 drifters
** If the boat sinks or the player character dies, all drifters are lost.
** Returning to the mooring point gives +2 Karma per drifter.

 [Seabed]
* The sea's version of the Wilderness map. Exiting from the edge of the map returns you to your ship.
** The map will have seamonster race enemies [and other objects] placed; enemy [and object] selection is dependent on deepest dungeon floor cleared.
** Enemies that continuously spawn with the passage of turns are of seamonster race, and depend on deepest dungeon floor cleared.
** Wet status is applied to all characters every turn. There is also a decent chance (that is dependent on Swimming skill) of getting afflicted with additional turns of Dyspnea.
** The Swimming skill-dependent evasion modifier will work even when not on a water tile.
** Uncooked fish will not rot (including those in your inventory) even when not on a water tile.
** Wish will not work.
** Weather effects will not be displayed, but this counts as outdoors so you will be subjected to the effects of Etherwind when it happens.
** North Tyris and South Tyris seabed maps have a slightly different tint.

 [New special actions]
* Shadow Hop
** Learned upon level up when Stealth skill is 20 or greater. Wide-area special action.
** Expend half of maximum HP and summon 25 shade NPCs allied to the summoner.
** The level of each shade is dependent on the user's [character level] and Stealth skill level. When the player character is the summoner, the level is capped at 3/2 times the deepest dungeon floor cleared.
** The maximum HP of each shade is equal to the HP expended during the summoning, divided by 25. Upper limit is 2,000 and lower limit is 1.
** When used by an NPC, the shades will have the same appearance and name as the summoner.
** Fails to activate if the user's HP is less than half of the maximum.
** It will also fail the second time onward for the same user until the user enters a new map.
** Summoned shades will disappear when changing maps.
** <Getuei>the ninja master and shadow now use this when they meet the requirements.

* Shadow Jump
** Learned upon level up when Stealth skill is 40 or greater. Wide-area special action.
** Move to the target. (Is not considered a teleport). If the target is not currently afflicted with Bind, 5 turns of Bind is applied to it.
** Flavour-wise, this allows the user to use shadows for moving around and binding targets.
** This will affect targets who are not in sight.
** That means that targets who teleport away to heal can be chased down with this special action.
** Does not apply any damage, so you can target a non-hostile NPC to move to them.
** It doesn't deal damage so that players can't use this to hit and run enemies.
** It will fail when used by the steed currently being ridden or the right side of a tag team as they aren't allowed to move of their own volition.
** <13th step ghost>, ghost, and ninja now use this.


 ===2.17: detailed changelog===
 [New special actions]
* <Limit Power>
** Learned by the player character when leveling up to level 20 or greater.
** Temporarily decreases the attributes of the targeted player character/pet by a percentage. The range of percentages that Speed will be decreased by is smaller. Luck is unaffected.
** Choose between different limiter levels - the higher the level, the greater the attribute reduction.
** Enabling the limiter or switching limiter levels will reset the power gauge to 0.
** Attributes cannot be restored by Restore Body or other similar methods. Buffs that increase the attributes remain unchanged.
** HP and other stats will get recalculated as well, but your character may do surprisingly well in battle because character level, skill levels, and resistances remain unchanged.
** If you feel you've over-leveled your character or want to give yourself a challenge, this feature is for you.
** Or, you can go "Is that all you've got? I'm not even using half my strength" or "Mwahaha, a worthy adversary! Time to get a little serious" or "It's been a while since I've fought at full strength. Try not to die" and roleplay some character who usually suppresses their strength. Like a BBEG or something.
	
* <Limiter Vanish>
** Learned by the player character when leveling up to level 20 or greater.
** Completely remove the limiter placed on the selected character. Requires power gauge to be at 50% or greater (but will not consume any power gauge).
** Recovers 50% of the original maximum HP, MP, and SP values.
** Will also buff the character with Holy Shield, Feather, Attribution Shield, Super Regene, and Holy Veil. The strength of these buffs is dependent on the amount the attributes were previously decreased by the limiter.
** Also deals damage to all enemies in sight. The damage is dependent on the amount the attributes were previously decreased by the limiter, limiter level, and character level. This damage is reducible by the target's Constitution.
** Removing the limiter basically unleashes devastation on nearby enemies.

 [New items]
* white dark orb
** A tool that does not randomly spawn. Created with the dark fusion item fusion recipe.
** There are 6 types that each create different traps (see below).
** Using it will consume 5 abyss power and place a trap of that type at your character's feet.
** Like regular traps, they will disappear once set off by someone.
** Unlike pitfalls, landmines, and string traps, however, these will work on floating characters.
** Damage dealt by these traps is dependent on the player character's Magic Device and Disarm Trap skill levels. Strength of status ailment inflicted is dependent on Disarm Trap skill level and the danger level of the current map.
** poison spear: PV/DV damage + chance to inflict Poisoned
** sleepy spear: PV/DV damage + chance to inflict Sleep
** ink spear: PV/DV damage +  chance to inflict Blinded
** smelly spear: PV/DV damage +  chance to inflict Confused
** paralyze spear: PV/DV damage + chance to inflict Paralyzed
** vibrating spear: PV/DV damage + chance to inflict Dim

* awake destone
** Has a 1/10 chance of spawning when an NPC dies to damage that was not caused by an attack.
** Will not spawn if rare loot trigger is not on, and will not drop from enemies that are too weak.
** Stores the initial stats of the target that dropped it; those stats are summed together and multiplied by 1/10 to give the item level [that is displayed with the item name].
** The higher the level, the higher the selling price, but you may find these far too valuable to sell.
** When used, compares the user's INIT stat against that of character that dropped this. If the check passes, the user gains AP. The item will not be consumed if the check fails.
** Gives 5 times the amount of AP compared to normal means.
** Will not give the user's tag partner any AP.

** The point total resets to 0 whenever it reaches 1000 so that the number doesn't get too long.

* I: Actions
** I will drink something. Dousing your character with something will work. Drain Blood and the drinks that come with traveler's food are also accepted. Drinking or dousing yourself with melted chocolate will not work. (NB: The drink part of eating traveler's food may happen only if your character is thirsty enough.)
** I will walk on the world map. Can be cleared while riding a world-vehicle.
** I wll have a conversation with someone. [sic] Cannot be cleared when the target is unconscious or asleep. Conversations with NPCs who have 0 Attract is fine though, as are scripted event conversations.
** I will defeat high level enemy. The player character or a pet has to defeat a character who has a higher level than the player character.
** I will tell someone how I feel.
** I will visit Random Nefia. The Nefia does not have to be cleared for this to count.
** I will visit Wilderness. Ambushes and other random encounters will count.
** I will exercise until I feel lightly tired. The player character has to end the turn with low enough SP so that they are Tired or worse.

* II: Adventurers should have a well-balanced diet
** I will eat a meat. Any corpse will count. B-jerky and forbidden meat cannot be cooked, but these will also count.
** I will eat an egg.
** I will eat a vegetable. Jack lantern, mandrake salad, fried potato, and pop corn also accepted. Herbs and four-leaf clover are not accepted.
** I will eat a fruit. If there's any confusion as to what's a fruit and what's a vegetable, refer to the type of cooked food that the item produces when cooked. Magic fruit and happy apple are accepted.
** I will eat a bread. Sack of flour may be eaten raw and it will still count. Puff puff bread and stick bread are also accepted, but panty is of course not accepted.
** I will eat a nut. Gold acorn and crimberry can't be cooked but are accepted.
** I will eat a seafood. Again, this is based on the type of cooked food produced, so fish-like monster corpses do not count - those are considered meat.
** I will eat a noodle.

* III: Early to bed, early to rise. This is always chosen as the third quest. This is to railroad players into discovering the breakfast event.
** I will go to sleep between 21:00 and 23:59.

 [Daily quest rewards]
* Res upper
**  A tool that does not spawn randomly.
** Permanently increases all resistances of the character it is used on by one rank.
** The displayed resistances won't reflect any changes until two are used.
** This basically works the same as eating corpses, though the amount of resistance given is different. They share the same cap, after which no more resistance can be gained. Neither method will give resistances to an element that the character is "Criticaly Weak" (sic) to.
** Another difference is that if no more resistances can be gained from using this, it will prevent you from using the item. As such, you can't waste one of these even if you don't keep track of resistance gains.
** Characters who have no resistances to an element will have their damage received reduced from 100% to 40% after just one use, so this will have a significant impact even if you have a lot of pets.
** This can be used on anyone, but trying to use it on someone who doesn't have enough Impress will cause them to put up a fight since it's an injection.

* DV fixer
**  A tool that does not spawn randomly.
** Permanently increases the DV modifier of the character it is used on by 10. It cannot be used on characters who already have 200 or greater in the modifier.
** This can be used on anyone, but trying to use it on someone who doesn't have enough Impress will cause them to put up a fight since it's an injection.

* PV fixer
**  A tool that does not spawn randomly.
** Permanently increases the PV modifier of the character it is used on by 10. It cannot be used on characters who already have 200 or greater in the modifier.
** This can be used on anyone, but trying to use it on someone who doesn't have enough Impress will cause them to put up a fight since it's an injection.

* Reward order:
** Res -> DV -> PV -> DV -> PV -> DV -> PV -> Res (loops back to beginning)

 [New items]
* mana destone
** Does not spawn randomly. A tool, not an ore.
** Guaranteed to drop from NPCs who die from magic reaction.
** Has a Lv that reflects the NPC's level. Selling price increases with its Lv.
** Using it recovers 10% of total MP and gives Magic attribute experience proportional to its Lv.

* fighting destone
** Does not spawn randomly. A tool, not an ore.
** Guaranteed to drop from enemies after defeating them with Persuasion special actions.
** Has a Lv that reflects the NPC's level. Selling price increases with its Lv.

* X-Frame
** Obtained when you talk to Gavela with a potioman that has been upgraded by Miral.
** Usable on upgraded potiomans. Cannot be removed once attached to a potioman.
** Added a second characteristic to the potioman. This cannot be the same characteristic as the first.
** An "X" is appended to the potioman's item name after usage and its sprite will changed a bit.
** Only one X-Frame can be used per potioman even if you have multiple X-Frames.
** Using this will also grant the Custom Change special action (see below).

 [New special action]
* Custom Change
** Change the second characteristic of a potioman equipped with an X-Frame.
** This cannot be the same characteristic as the first.

 [New gauge attack]
* Hyper Plug Burst
** Procs when the target is still alive after a potioman has been used and the user's power gauge is 100%. Expends the power gauge when used.
** A Strength attribute-dependent gauge attack that has a chance of getting its damage reduced by the target's Greater Evasion.
** After that, sets the potioman that was used to +3 (or +4 if it was a cf potioman), and if you have enough potion plugs, sets the number of bullets to 4.
** Gives the user Marksman experience.
** Is the same as other gauge attacks in other respects.

 ===2.14: detailed changelog===
 [New items]
* dernefia
** A flower that does not randomly spawn. Considered a junk item.
** Probability of getting spawned increases as the danger level of the floor [within a Nefia] increases.
** The probability starts out at 1/75 and caps at 1/20 at danger level 100. It does not spawn in floors that are randomly generated when reentering the map.
** Greatly increases favor when offered to Jure of Healing (like coconut crabs for Ehekatl).

 [New special actions]
* Direct Transfusion
** Learned upon leveling up when Gene engineer skill is 10 or higher and Dexterity is 30 or higher.
** Select two characters in adjacent tiles to transfuse blood between them. The player character may be one of them.
** This is considered an attack on the character who has blood drawn, and a Gene engineer skill level-dependent bleed will be applied.
** The blood recipient will have a Gene engineer skill level-dependent reduction in number of turns of bleed the character is afflicted with.

* Electric Shock
** Learned upon leveling up when Gene engineer skill is 25 or higher and Magic is 50 or higher.

 [New NPC]
* <Boyciana>
* Level 20 bird. Floats. Vanish on low health. Does not randomly spawn.

I may have put too much effort into making this feature so it's kind of complicated.
You may want to read the following while playing or after playing around with it so that it makes more sense.

 [About giving birth]
* Using a SurvivabilityEXtenderX will ensure that the child born is female.
* Using a SurvivabilityEXtenderY will ensure that the child born is male. Only the sex will be different; everything else will be the same.
* When the target is an NPC, a player character Dexterity-dependent value + target's Impress + target's master/servant value will be rolled against the target's Strength to determine if the target resists.
* Non-pet NPCs become immediately hostile when they resist.
* The roll succeeds more easily if the target is asleep, unconscious, or has less than 1/8 HP remaining. There is no such roll when the target is the player character.
* Using the item successfully will cause the target to enter phase 1. If the target is currently pregnant with a parasite, that parasite will be removed.
* The target will also become immune to pregnancy during phases 1 and 2.
* Every additional time the EXtender items are used during phase 1 will increase the number of children born later by 1.
** Which means using it a total of 2 times will cause twins to be born, 3 times for triplets, and so on. Using X and Y once each will cause fraternal twins (i.e. one male and one female child) to be born. The upper limit is 9 male and 9 female, so be sure to have enough pet slots free.

 [Phase 1]
* There will be a blinking heart icon.
* Drawing blood via Direct Transfusion, attacking with Drain Blood, attacking with Voracity Fang, finishing a little tail t'night, finishing a little tail t'night [in evochat], reaching the limit with Sleep Sharing, or making a gene will give you the target's gene and increase progress.
* The former 3 types of actions will use only [the target character] to increase progress, while the latter 4 will use both [the target and the initiator of the action].
* The highest base resistance of each of the first two targets a gene is obtained from will be used.
* The NPC type is determined by last target a gene is obtained except when that target is the player character.
* The later the action appears in the list above and the higher the target's base resistance, the greater the progress made when a gene is obtained in that manner.
* Genes for a child do not have be all obtained from the same target.
* It'll be faster to do this with high level monsters or by using the genes of some NPC with high resistances, but lower level genes will still suffice - you just need more of them.
* When progress is 100% or greater, phase 2 begins.

 [Phase 2]
* There will be a large blinking heart icon.
* Satiety decreases at double the rate. The greater the satiety gained from eating food, the greater the progress gained.
* Vomiting due to eating cursed food or anorexia has no effect on progress.
* When progress is 100% or greater, phase 2 ends.
* The children will all be born at once and join as pets.
* If there are more children than there are empty pet slots, those who cannot fit will disappear.
* One <Boyciana> NPC will also spawn during birth that cannot be recruited as a pet.
* If it is an NPC giving birth, all children will be of the same NPC type as the NPC.
* If it is the player character giving birth, the children will be the same type as the last NPC a gene was obtained from.
* The sex of the child depends completely on the X or Y item used even if it's a male-only or female-only NPC type.
* The children spawn at level 1, age 0, are considered unique NPCs, and have no portraits, no items, 1/5 height, and 1/10 weight. You'll have to name them yourself too.
* If you want two NPCs to have children, you'll definitely need to use Direct Transfusion to transfer genes between them. To feed a non-pet NPC, throw food at them when they're hungry.
* There are no limitations on this feature - you can make your wife give birth using a whole bunch of goblin and orc genes. If you're shipping a couple of characters you can make them sire children, or even give birth to their children on their behalf. Or you could do ridiculous things like make your newborn twins have kids of their own. All that and more is possible. Not that there are any advantages of doing so. Feel free to act according to your moral compass.

 [About the child who is born]
* The two resistances gained during phase 1 will have 4 ranks added to each of them. (If these two are of the same element, 8 ranks will be added to it.)
* The move set of the last NPC a gene was obtained from will apply. This does not include moves that are only used under certain circumstances. This means you can use a good move set to strengthen a weak NPC type.
* A Blank Business Card cannot be used until the child is fully grown.
* They start at -5 sprite size, and this is unaffected by using blessed or cursed milk on them.
* They will grow in 5 stages, and their current stage is displayed in the conversation window below their portrait.
* Investments can be made up to 10 times per growth stage.
* Simply select the option to invest, spend Attract and gold pieces, and experience will be given to all skills in the selected category of skills. The amount of experience given is unaffected by skill training days (Training-day, Combat-day, etc).
* Amount of skill experience gained depends on the player character's Learning attribute. Investing gives a slight amount of Investing skill experience to the player character.
* Making the child do something they have an interest in will increase their Impress towards the player, pick a random skill 15 times and give twice as much experience as compared to when other options are picked. (When a skill that the child doesn't have gets picked, the experience is wasted.)
* When 10 investments have been made for the current phase AND one of the following is fulfilled:
** the child's level is 10 * growth phase or greater
** the child's age is 3 * growth phase or greater
* ...an option to <Acknowledge child's growth> will show up in the conversation window. Selecting it will advance the child to the next growth phase, increase their sprite size by 1, and raise their age to a predetermined value.

 [Growth stages of children]
* baby phase
** All random events have a high chance of getting overwritten by a child crying event.
** All random sleep events (except for Lucky Day, Treasure of Dream, and Quirk of Fate - the latter two give a treasure map and a statue of Ehekatl respectively) have a high chance of getting overwritten by your child crying event.
** This chance is calculated separately for every child on the map who is neither asleep nor unconscious.
** The options you pick will change the child's Impress and Master/Servant value towards you.
** The correct option you have to pick will change depending on the child's state, so as their guardian it's best if you know what's going on.
** When determining their state, the baby's stats have the following priorities: power gauge 0% < HP is 90% or below < Satiety is below Satisfied.
** They have a 5% chance of falling asleep for 100 to 400 turns.
** During combat, they also have a 20% chance of gambolling around (NB: "rolling fine!") and ending their turn.

* NO phase
** All random events have a decent chance of getting overwritten by your child whining.
** This chance is calculated separately for every child on the map who is neither asleep nor unconscious.
** The options you pick will have a slight effect on their Impress and Master/Servant value towards you.
** During this phase, attempting to give them items or take items from them will have a 50% chance of failing. Very annoying.
** They have a 5% chance of falling asleep for 50 to 200 turns.
** During combat, they also have a 15% chance of "hopping and playing" around and ending their turn.

* infancy phase
** All random events have a low chance of getting overwritten by 1 of 3 events that may occur in their place.
** This chance is calculated separately for every child on the map who is neither asleep nor unconscious.
** The options you pick will have a slight effect on their Impress and Master/Servant value towards you.
** They have a 5% chance of falling asleep for 50 to 200 turns between 11pm and 6am.
** During combat, they have a 10% chance of "looking away with interest" and ending their turn.

* growth phase
** All random events have a slight chance of getting overwritten by 1 of 3 events that may occur in their place.
** This chance is calculated separately for every child on the map who is neither asleep nor unconscious.
** The options you pick will have no effect on anything.
** They have a 2% chance of falling asleep for 50 to 200 turns between 11pm and 6am.
** During combat, they have a 5% chance of "thinking with a serious face!" and ending their turn.

* puberty phase
** Their manner of speech and how they refer to themselves [in the Japanese version] will change to a random one when entering this phase.
** All random events have a slight chance of getting overwritten by 1 of 3 events that may occur in their place.
** This chance is calculated separately for every child on the map who is neither asleep nor unconscious.
** They will have a 50% chance of refusing Directives or command flag orders.
** In combat, the lower the master/servant value, the higher their chance (ranging from 5% to 20%) of simply ending their turn.
** At the end of this phase, the child bit flag is removed and they will be considered a fully-fledged ally.
 
 
===2.13: detailed changelog===
 [Blackjack reward tiers]
* The number of items you will receive every time you claim the reward has greatly increased, so be sure to have space in your inventory!
** Reward Lv 1+ - Reward-Lv dependent armour. Item quality tier increases at Lv7, 14, 21, and 28.
** Additional reward at Lv 5+ - gift
** Additional reward at Lv 9+ - potion of cure corruption
** Additional reward at Lv 11+ - unicorn horn
** Additional reward at Lv 13+ - Blank Business Card
** Additional reward at Lv 15+ - scroll of faith
** Additional reward at Lv 17+ - high potion of wisdom
** Additional reward at Lv 19+ - golden mead
** Additional reward at Lv 23+ - potion of potential
** Additional reward at Lv 25+ - SurvivabilityEXtenderX and SurvivabilityEXtenderY
** Additional reward at Lv 27+ - master of diamond, master of heart, master of club, and master of spade. Second time claiming this tier and onwards will award the <Slash Joker> instead.
** Additional reward at Lv 29+ - starfiber
** Additional reward at Lv 31+ - craft repair kit
** Additional reward at Lv 33+ - <super lure>. Second time claiming this tier and onwards will award the high potion of soma instead.
** Additional reward at Lv 35+ - skeleton key. Second time claiming this tier and onwards will award the high potion of nektar instead.

** All the "additional reward" tier items will be paid out only if the rare loot trigger is on.
** If you want the item from a particular reward tier, just bet the number of chips required to reach it. Picking "I'm out" decreases reward level by 1 while winning increases it by 2, so adjust accordingly.
** Reaching a reward tier will also unlock the precious item for that tier as a reward from the little sister quest. This is so that players who miss out on the reward due to a full inventory can still obtain it.

 [New items with unimplemented effects]
* master of diamond
** Does not spawn randomly.
** In the future, I intend to implement a play-style where you summon spirits from cards, and having the different types of spirits in poker hand combinations will proc certain effects.

* master of heart
** As above.

* master of club
** As above.

* master of spade
** As above.

* SurvivabilityEXtenderX
** Low chance of generating randomly.
** Will be for making children, giving birth, and child rearing. Independent of the system for gene-making and incarnating an adventurer.

** Gives the user Dexterity and Marksman skill experience.
** Can be recharged.
** Basically a variant of the M202 special and panzerfaust X.

** Using it grants +100 potion plugs.
** The spawn rate is rather low because this is a useless item unless you use potiomans.

* starfiber
** A tool that does not spawn randomly. Crafted with item fusion.
** Use this to give the selected living weapon 75 experience.

* spiritium
** Spawns only when a treasure chest does not generate herbs as a reward.
** Each has a subtype (listed below). Every subtype gives the same effects.
** Cannot be used on non-pet NPCs. Up to 2 spiritium can be used per character.
** Further spiritium usage causes the first [CHARA] trait to become the second, and the new spiritium becomes the first [CHARA] trait.
** The same trait cannot be acquired twice. The different traits are more or less for flavour purposes.
** Acquired traits are listed under Feats and Traits.
** Acquiring the first trait grants +3 power gauge when entering a map.
** Acquiring the second trait gives +1 power gauge whenever damage is received.
** Spiritium types (this should cover just about everything, but more could be added in the future if there's a need for that):

===2.12: detailed changelog===
 [New map]
* the Church of Older Sister
** A new map beneath Ludus.
** Map regenerates after a few days.
** Cannot be Returned to.
** Enter this map by completing the Removal of sister quest and speaking to the older sister NPC.
** It's like the mansion of younger sister but of a different flavour.

 [New special actions]
* Pollen cannon
** Single-target ranged attack that does not deal any damage per se.
** Rolls to apply all of the following at the same time: Wince, Chills, Blinded, Paralyzed, Confused, Dim, Poisoned, and a Perception debuff.
** If the target's current Perception attribute is already less than half of base Perception, the debuff is not applied.
** The strength of all debuffs is dependent on the user's character level.
** Now you can suffer from pollen allergies even in game (ugh).

* Eye of Ane
** A joke special action that acts as the counterpart to little sister summoning.
** Can be learned by speaking to the <Sister> NPC listed below.
** When used by the player character, you will gain 1 ane power experience and the current "ane attribute" will change to a different one.
** Gaining experience for all 13 ane attributes will cause ane power level to increase by 1.
** Ane power is capped at the same value as the player character's level.
** Current ane power and ane attribute can be determined by speaking to the <Sister> NPC.
** When used, it heals the target's HP by an ane power-dependent amount by some unknown mechanism. (If used by NPCs, that HP recovery is dependent on their character level instead.)
** It has no effect when used on older sister-type NPCs and will fail.
** When successfully used, it also removes the user's Melancholy status ailment. Naturally, it does not alleviate the drug dependence associated with it.
** This is considered an "Eye of ___"-type attack, so you can actually tack on other effects to it with Abyss in the eye. It can also be used to proc Mind Break when power gauge is full.


 [New NPCs]
* helraune
** Level 183 mandrake. Female only.
** Pollen cannon, Anaphylaxis, Poison Bolt, Nether Roar.

** Using it will recover the target's MP by a player character ane power-dependent amount.
** The amount it recovers isn't that much, but if you carry a lot of these you can easily counter any MPoison ailments on any character.


===2.11: detailed changelog===
 [Effects of the Aurtehom]
* Reading Aurtehom will cause one of the effects listed below.
** Reading it, however, will decrease Abyss power and/or do SAN damage.
** SAN damage is a roll to check if insanity increases. It can be mitigated with Mind resistance, with Jure's feat, or by being drunk.

* [Abyss Leading]
** Starts unlocked at 0 Abyss power.
** Removes all items on the map that are unowned (i.e. can be picked up without Pickpocket) except for Aurtehom itself.
** To prevent accidental usage, there is a confirmation dialogue that will show up after picking this option.
** For every type of item removed, it increases Abyss power by 1. This had to be limited to 1 point per type of item or else gold pieces would give a lot of points.
** This is a way of obtaining Abyss power other than by doing quests and reading ancient books. Also for cleaning Nefias.

* [Phantom Swords]
** Unlocked when Abyss power is 500 or above.
** Does Literacy and Magic Device skill-dependent cut element damage to all enemies in sight. It also rolls to decapitate enemies that have less than 1/8 maximum HP left.

* [Evil Guardians]
** Unlocked when Abyss power is 3000 or above.
** Summons the 3 types of dark guardians (see below) as allies.
** They are not marked by the summoned bit flag but disappear when changing maps.

** Unlocked when Abyss power is 4000 or above.
** A Literacy skill-dependent roll to silence all enemies in sight.
** If [the target] is not already afflicted by Choked, inflicts 1 turn of Choke on them (equivalent to 15 turns of Dyspnea).

 [New item]
* command whistle
** An item that can randomly spawn. A type of junk.
** Using it will decrease the guard break gauge of all characters in sight by 5%. This includes the user and enemies.
** It has no effect on characters who are already in guard break state.

 [New special action]
* Individual Leading
** Learned upon level up when the Natural Leader feat is acquired (the one that also grants Cheer) and Learning is 30 or greater.
** Decreases the selected ally's guard break gauge by up to 50%, and increase the user's guard break gauge by the amount decreased.
** If this brings the user's guard break gauge to 100% or greater, it sets it to 99%. The amount of guard break that "disappears" will affect the rate at which guard break gauge naturally decreases.
** This special action fails if the target already has its guard broken or is out of sight.
** Non-pet temporary NPC allies can also be selected as targets.
** The flavour text for the target's reaction can be customized with dbModeTxtLeading.
** Something I'd like to implement in the future is the ability to play a type of character that doesn't fight but is able to command allies effectively to win battles.

 [New option that bartenders offer]
* Order a special drink for 1 bronze coin.
** It applies a new buff to all party members that increases all skill experience earned by 10%.

* Started by talking to Amurdad.
** Escort an NPC out of a 6-floor quest dungeon.
** Teleport, Return, Escape, and saving the game are disabled while in the dungeon.
** The conversation and the options presented in the dungeon are just flavour text and affect nothing.

** When used on a target, it increases every single one of the target's attributes (except for Speed and Luck) to 150.
** Can be reused after 480 hours.

* The above items are meant to give newly-recruited pets a leg up and save you some trouble in leveling up their attributes. They won't help with skill levels though.
** The cooldown is there so that you can't buy slaves, increase their stats, then sell them again for a profit. It shouldn't be too restrictive unless you recruit a whole bunch of pets at a time.

* G-Finger
** Received from Sophia after clearing Act III. 1 hour cooldown.
** Using it on an enemy at 1/10 hp or lower kills them instantly and creates a golden doll (see below) in their place.

* Contradiction

** When used while not standing in water, it greatly increases hydration and slightly increases satiety.
** Cannot be used on wells as that would overlap with the function of empty bottles.
** Can be cursed or blessed, but that has no effect on its effect when used.


===2.04: detailed changelog===
 [New special actions]
* Serious Begging
** Learned when the player character wakes up with less than 500 gold.
** Auto-turns occur, the Attract of nearby NPCs is consumed, and you receive an amount of gold dependent on the target's level.
** When used by the player, blessed food may get thrown your way sometimes.
** (Those food items ordered by rarity are sweet potato, stick bread, rice ball, and jerky).
** It fails if the target has no Attract left, and when the user has more gold than the target.
** Failing will not cause NPCs to throw rocks at you, but fame will decrease (amount decreased is the same as failing a town board quest) when receiving gold from [a pet].
** Usable regardless of skill levels and attributes but yields neither points in a party time quest nor experience.
** Newly-spawned beggar NPCs are now able to use this, and you can also direct pets [who are Amenable or above] to beg in towns.
** Characters too weak for adventure now have a way to survive in exchange for their pride.

* Tickling Hell
** Learned upon level up by the player character when Dexterity is 30 or greater.
** If the target is not already afflicted by Bind, Binds the target for 1 turn.
** Deals SP damage to the target that is dependent on the user's Dexterity and resisted by the target's Constitution.
** If the target's Perception is greater than its Dexterity, then power gauge is also decreased by 10%.
** If the target's SP is less than half full, then it also gives the target a user Dexterity-dependent insanity check.
** This deals no HP damage but is considered an attack.
** harpy, dragon's pet harpy, roper, skogsra, performaid cocruel, halloween children, diabolic clown, titania, and town child now use this. (Only newly-spawned NPCs will have it.)

 [New NPCs]

 [New special actions]
* Resonant Voice
** When any of the Negotiation special actions (NB: Persuasion, Peculiar joke, Blended lie, Intimidation, Mysterious song) are used while gauge is 100% or greater, this special action will be used instead.
** Subtracts 50% from 1 enemy's power gauge (can make power gauge negative) and deal Negotiation, Analysis, Will, and equipment +enhance value-dependent SP damage.
** The damage calculation is the same as that of the Negotiation special actions. Unlike those special actions, however, this uses only 1 turn (NB: Negotiation special actions take 1 turn + 5 auto-turns) and there is no chance of failure.

* Harmonic Assault	
** Learned upon level up when the Empathy feat has been acquired, Negotiation skill is 50 or greater, and Analysis skill is 30 or greater.
** Applies a buff of the same name to all allies in sight.
** NPCs that have this buff and are set to "Talking" mode will provide support to other allied characters when they use the Negotiation special actions.
** This "support" increases the chance of success of the special actions by a supporter's Analysis skill level-dependent amount. The additional chance from all supporting characters is summed up then added to the base chance.
** The increase in chance is recalculated when the Negotiation special actions used, and again when the special action activates. (NB: Due to the 5 turn delay of Negotiation special actions.)
** Characters with the buff will also no longer have their Negotiation special actions interrupted when receiving damage.

* Jyusou Goushin
** Attempts to apply curse of Will-dependent strength to every piece of equipment the user is wearing.
** The curse cannot be prevented by the Exorcist feat, but will be prevented by the "protects you from cursing words" equipment attribute.
** After rolling to curse, if at least 1 piece of equipment as been cursed, the user's HP is healed and the user receives a buff of the same name.
** The amount healed and the strength of the buff depend on the user's Will and the number of pieces of equipment cursed (every piece doomed counts as two).
** Attribute increases from the buff is capped at 666, but there is no cap in the increase in resistance to magic.
** curse wood king, <13th step ghost>, profanity priest, diabolic clown, <Exossil>, <Ulzassil>, and <Ssil> the undead witch now have a chance to use this special action when they do not have its buff.
** This affects instances of the aforementioned NPCs in existing saves.

* Love Crafting
** Has a 50% chance of attempting to apply Perception-dependent insanity to every single enemy in sight.
** Is AOE unlike Eye of Insanity, but again, it works only half the time and its strength is also about half.
** It also [has a 100% chance to] set an enemy's power gauge to -5% if their current power gauge is between 5 to 80%.
** <Mad scientist>, Jure fanatic, cupid of death, <Insane Kumiromi>, <Kumiromi>, <Caim> the mad rich, wangnin, abyss animal, and lunatyeek will now use this.
** This change does not affect instances of the aforementioned NPCs in existing saves.

* Kijin Shibari
** Learned upon level up when Literacy skill is 30 or greater.
** Expend 10 of a selected scroll to apply 0 to 2 turns of Bind to all enemies on the map.
** Also attempts to lower enemies' Dexterity by a Literacy skill-dependent amount. (Dexterity won't be lowered if the current value is already less than half of base value.)

* Burn Scrolls
** Learned upon level up when Literacy skill is 40 or greater.
** Expend 20 of a selected scroll to apply Literacy skill and Magic attribute-dependent fire damage to 1 enemy.
** Also removes 1 buff from the target.

 [Changes to the AI of existing unique NPCs]
* <King Cockroach>
** Now has a high chance to use Shadow rush.
** Used to be a pushover despite its size. Maybe it'll now be able to show intruders what "strength in numbers" means?

* <Goda> the captain of orc
** Now has a low chance to use Shadow rush. A bit more captain-y now.

* Female hand of the dead, hand of the chaos, and hand of the murderer evolve with magic heart into hime ooteguchi and learn Melt Clinch.

 [New items]
* memory converter
** Reward for clearing random Nefia.
** Depending on the danger level, 1 to 5 is given as a reward. (Maximum of 5 is given at danger level 200.)
** An additional 1 is given if the Nefia cleared was awakened.
** An additional 1 is given if Nefia fever is in effect.
** The item name specifies a skill; what skill it is depends on the boss' race.
** Using it halves the skill level of that skill and gives 3 skill bonus points.
** It cannot be used unless the skill's level is 5 or greater.
** For lowering skills that a character doesn't need and increasing the ones that are actually useful.
** Or for roleplaying purposes - lowering a skill that a character shouldn't be good at.

* The 4 items listed below spawn randomly with a random colour.
** They cannot be wished for because they have no name in the code.
** All of them have an ammo capacity of 4. 
** When used and ammo is 0, it will reload, taking 1 turn.
** When used and ammo is 1 or greater, it will deal Strength and Marksman skill-dependent HP and MP damage to the target. It always hits and ignores defence.
** Blend it with potions to increase its +enhance value. The +enhance value depends on the cumulative value of all potions blended with it.
** When +enhanced, the damage calculation will also factor in the user's Magic attribute and the shooting animation will change. After firing, the +enhance value will be reset to 0.

* super potioman - damage calculation multiplies Strength by 4/3.

* battle potioman - firing it increases PV by 100 till the next turn.

* crush potioman - procs grenade (dependent on user's Strength and Marksman skill) if used when remaining ammo is 1.

* cf potioman - value of potions blended with it is multiplied by 3. The others have a maximum +enhance value of 3, but this one's maximum is 4. 

* B-Da*an are probably not coming back in the Reiwa era and it's too hard to get a hold of Bott*eman toys, so I figured I'd at least enjoy them in-game.
** Both of these toys shoot bottle caps. Potions are the Irvan equivalent [of PET bottles] because of their availability. Put these two facts together, and we get... the potioman!
** There aren't any metal stoppers for potion bottles, so no metal potiomans.
** The limited ammo, guaranteed hits, damage ignoring, and MP damage-dealing mean that these are supposed to be used on tough enemies. You could use them on regular enemies, but that'd be a huge waste.

* These 4 items can also be modified by <Miral> the legendary smith once.
** Modifying it will change the item's prefix and give the item an equipment attribute.
** Its colour before modification determines its form and suffix after modification. Changing its colour afterwards will not affect its form and name.

* Equipment attributes applied during modification and their effect:
** (These equipment attributes are purely cosmetic; the game doesn't base item effect on whether the attributes are present or not. [The modification data is stored elsewhere.])
** It gives a tremendous rotation to plug. Rolls to apply user's Strength-dependent Dim. Also rolls to decapitate (procs at 1/10 HP).
** It has high basic power. Multiplies base damage by 1.1.
** It fires two shots at the same time. Multiplies base damage by 1.8. Ammo consumption doubled.
** It can shoot continuously. Reloading no longer takes a turn.
** It allows precise shooting. There is no longer any variance in damage dealt. Damage dealt is always the maximum amount possible.
** It confuses with a changing trajectory. Rolls to apply user's Dexterity-dependent confusion, decreases the target's evasion by 100 DV until the target's next turn, and deals a small amount of user's Dexterity-dependent SP damage.

 [Artifact for exchange at Miral's]
* nyoi mimikaki
** 24 hours cooldown time. Can be used on adjacent tiles on any NPC (even hostile ones) as long as their Impress is at Fellow or above.
** The inside of the ear is gross so it's been blurred out.

* Cleaning an NPC's ears:

* Option 1:
** Put in carefully -> Put in all the way -> Carefully scrape
** The player character's Dexterity and Perception and target's Constitution and Will are rolled against the target's base Speed. This option is displayed only if the roll succeeds.
** If you manage to reach the 3rd stage, then the player character's Dexterity is rolled to determined the level (1 to 5) of earwax removed.
** Round 2 then begins. Succeeding again will end the ear cleaning.
** This won't give you any earwax items, but the greater the level of earwax removed, the greater the amount of Dexterity and Perception experience (for the player character) as well as Constitution and Will experience (for the target) received. Even for low levels [of earwax], the amount of experience given is comparable to herbed food.

* Option 2:
** Size adjustment
** An option that shows only when the player character's Will successfully rolls against the target's Will. Resets Size expansion.

* Option 3:
** Size expansion -> Size large expansion -> Rupture of ear canal
** Going all the way to the 3rd stage will roll to apply a fixed amount of bleed and end the session. Impress decreases by quite a bit but this is not considered an attack.

* Option 4:
** Thrust -> Stick in the ear -> Break through the eardrum
** Going all the way to the 3rd stage will deal player character Strength-dependent sound damage.
** Impress greatly decreases but is not considered an attack, so this can be used as a legal form of assassination.

* When used on the player character and getting an NPC to clean your character's ears:

* If the NPC is hostile, it deals Strength-dependent sound damage and ends.

* Otherwise, it rolls NPC's Dexterity and Perception and player character's Constitution and Will against player character's Speed 3 times.
** Upon success, it rolls the NPC's Dexterity to determine the level (1 to 5) of earwax removed.
** The higher the level, the higher the experience given to the NPC's Dexterity and Perception and to the player character's Constitution and Will.
** All of this happens twice per use.
** When the roll fails, bleed is applied and it ends.


===2.02: detailed changelog===
 [New items]
* manuscript
** Does not spawn randomly. Junk item.

* book
** Has the appearance of a red book but is a different item. Does not have an item name. Does not spawn randomly.

* operating board
** Tool that does not spawn randomly. Using it has the same effect as a house board.
** Can be offered to Mani.

 [Effects of table furniture]
* Using a big table, table, ragged table, comfortable table, academic table, or modern table will display the options listed below.
** Other tables didn't seem suitable for writing, so those won't work.
** All of the tables in the above list work the same way; there is no bonus for using a particular table.

* Manuscript production
** Your character goes into auto-turn. 1 idea is expended every turn to produce 1 manuscript.
** Auto-turn does not end until interrupted or until there are no more ideas. Ideas cap at 100.
** There are 7 tiers of manuscript quality, indicated by the modifier in the item name: paper scraps, noob, commonplace, good sense, cool, satisfied, and masterpiece.
** As Literacy skill, Perception attribute, and Learning attribute increase, high-quality manuscripts will get produced more often.
** Identifying manuscripts will immediately reveal their quality, unlike in real life.

* Self-publishing
** Uses the entire stack of selected manuscripts and 30,000 gold to produce 100 red books, already identified.
** The quality of books inherit the manuscript quality. Cannot be used when there are fewer than 10 manuscripts in the selected stack.
** The title of the book is randomly generated during creation, but has no effect on the book price.
** The price of the book is dependent on the quality of manuscripts used in its creation and the number of manuscripts used (capped at 1,000).
** The publishing cost is fixed no matter how many manuscripts go into the book, so publishing more manuscripts at a time will increase your profit.
** Unlike in real life, books will fetch a decent price even if nobody has ever heard of the author.
** [The first sale from a batch of 100 books] will also give a small amount of fame. (You won't be notified of the increase if the book was sold in your shop.)
** The amount of fame gained is independent of the number of manuscripts in the book, and is solely dependent on book quality.
** This means that you can sell a lot of books with few manuscripts in them to increase fame, or sell books with a lot of manuscripts to earn money.
** Again, unlike in real life, you won't have to worry about unsold books, so you won't be able to reprint books - there won't be any more than 100 copies of a book.

* Spellbook conversion
** Halves the amount of spell stock for the selected spell. For every 1000 spell stock removed, create 1 spellbook with 1 charge of that spell.
** Cannot be used for spells that do not have a corresponding spellbook, and for spells that you do not have 2,000 or more in spell stock.
** For spells that have too much spell stock.

 [New Act III sub quest]
* Garziem
** Talk to Garziem in Albedrion to move to another floor of the map. This new floor[, like towns,] gets regenerated once every few days.
** There won't be any instructions from any NPCs, but what you have to do is work on tasks A, B, and C using the operating board provided.
** (You can also use a house board if you brought one in.)
** Working on a task spends stamina and time every turn. Success depends on Perception and Learning attributes.
** Again, there won't be any specific details on how to do the tasks in-game, but A will not progress unless B is 500 or lower and your character's SP is at 50% or greater.
** B will not progress unless C is even and your character doesn't Need Sleep.
** C will not progress unless "Stay organized lightly" has been done 3 times or more and it is currently between 8am to 5pm.
** The "Stay organized lightly" counter decreases by 1 at 12am (does not go negative), and is reset [to 0] when quitting the game.
** After reducing task quota for all 3 tasks A, B, and C to 0, reporting to the NPC will reward you with a high potion of soma.
** Reporting when A's quota is 500 or less from 12am-2am, when B's quota is 500 or less from 3am-5am, and when C's quota is 500 or less from 12pm-2pm will increase their quota. Just remember that the afternoon and late night is risky.
** Picking "Stay organized lightly" 4 or more times and reporting to the NPC will reduce Impress, and reduce the number of times to 3. The message displayed changes up to 10 times, but there is otherwise no difference as long as the number of times is greater than 3.
** Reporting between 12am-5am will change the map's BGM.
** Talking to the NPC again after reporting task completion will offer different options.
** If Impress is Amiable or above and the correct options are selected, the sub quest is cleared.
** If you had lowered Impress by picking the "!!!" or "???" options in the previous choices, you'll have to raise it with love potions.
** When reporting with 0 Impress, there will be a special dialogue that occurs, after which Impress decreases even more.
** Regular conversations with NPCs on this map do not give the random Charisma-dependent increase in Impress.
** The quest map regenerates every few days, so you can go nuts with nukes and meteors.
** Going back out of the map [after clearing the sub quest] and talking to Garziem will award you with the N97 Cannon the first time.
** After clearing the quest, there is a 1/10 chance that it will become available again every time the date changes while the player isn't in Albedrion.
** The second time clearing the quest and onwards will reward a jewel of tear of god - the type depends on the time of day at which the reward is received.
** This quest was made to resemble those retro puzzle games where conditions are unclear and hard to grasp.
** But there's no time limit and you can brute-force it or figure it out with the in-game hints easily.
** And once you figure it out it should be a piece of cake. Besides, the detailed changelog has all the details right here. It'll be a piece of cake, right???


===2.01: detailed changelog===

** Pick your target from a list and then it'll show you a list of messages to pick.
** [Adventurers who have been recruited as] pets, as well as adventurers on the same map cannot be picked.
** The messages are listed below. When a message activates it will get cleared.
** If you select another message before a message activates, the new message will overwrite the current one.

** Please cancel my message.
*** Removes the message.

** <I want to get along with you>
*** Impress increases when talking to the target. If the target is currently hostile, entering the map the target is on will [remove the hostility].

** <Please come to my house to play>
*** This target will have a greatly increased priority to get picked when generating a visitor to your home.

** <I love you!>
*** Impress greatly increases when talking to the target if the target's Impress is at Fellow or above. If Impress is less than that, it slightly decreases. 

** <I'm rooting for you!>
*** Guaranteed to nullify the "realized the limitations and retired" event for that adventurer once.

** <You don't have talents of  adventurer.>
*** Guaranteed to cause the adventurer to "realized the limitations" and retire after fully recovering from injury.

 [New NPCs]
* <Yayauhqui Tezcatlipoca>

** Distant Attack, Dimensional Move, Eye of Illusion, Attribute, Summon chaos (summons talon soldier that are 1/5 of own level that cannot be Dominated).
** Has the ability to negate smokescreens during its turn.

* <Jaldabaoth>The Chaos Child
** Level 1,200 god. Vulnerable to "inflicts massive damage to Gods", floats. Bonus chaos resistance.
** Eating corpse increases chaos resistance. Cancels Death Word on death.
** Has these moves but will not use them in the final battle of the main quest: Shadow Step, Chaos Breath, Fire Ball.

* <Orphe> the prince of lost kingdom
** Level 155 servant. Uses Shining Wave, Hero.

* <Orphe> the chaos disciple
** Level 350 servant. Vulnerable to "inflicts massive damage to Gods", floats. Bonus chaos resistance.
** Uses Chaos Ball, Shining Wave, Cowering Smile.

 [Additional main quest content]
* Talk to Leold to go to God's prison. Wish, 'P'raying, saving, and retreating are disabled as usual.
** <The Chaos Child> is here, but will never move and will respawn upon defeat.
** Defeat <Orphe> the chaos disciple to proceed to phase 2 of the event.
** [They] have the summoned NPC bit flag so [they] won't drop anything.
** Future versions may add an opportunity to fight them as well as other unique NPCs that the player hasn't had the opportunity to obtain the drops of yet.

* From phase 2 till the end, all characters will take turns one after another regardless of their speed.
** <Jaldabaoth>The Chaos Child's will use its unique special action Kamui during its turn, but the effects of that special action varies every turn it takes in the following manner:

* #1 <Respiration of Creative Gods> - recovers 10% of the user's max HP, MP, and SP.
* #2 <Roar of Fighting Gods> - sets user's power gauge to 200%.
* #3 <Assault of Beast Gods> - uses 50% of power gauge to halve the current HP of all characters other than the user. Will fail to work if the user does not have enough SP.
* #4 <Referee of Judicial Gods> - uses 50% of power gauge to roll to apply Punishment, Paralyze, and Death Word (can be resisted or nullified) to all characters other than the user. Will fail to work if the user does not have enough SP.
* #5 <Grudge of Abominable Gods> - uses 50% of power gauge to apply 1d100 of insanity to all characters other than the user. Will fail to work if the user does not have enough SP.
* #6 <Commandment of Hell Gods> - uses 50% of power gauge to halve the current power gauge and SP of all characters other than the user. Will fail to work if the user does not have enough SP.
* #7 (Phase 2) <Elements Killing> - deals a series of small amounts of reducible 12-elemental damage to the player character. (11 of the basic elements plus PVDV element.)
* #7 (Phase 4) <HOROBINOYARI> - deals 2x the player character's max HP in damage to the player character.

* Surviving 3 sets of these attacks or reducing Jaldabaoth's HP to half of the maximum (you can't kill it) will cause the event to enter phase 3.

* In phase 3, everything other than moving into another tile and physical attacks done this way is disabled.
** Damage-over-time will occur every turn and HP regeneration is disabled.
** There will be a counter at the top of the window which will be decreased whenever taking a lethal amount of damage, and the damage will be nullified.
** The counter starts at 26, and increases for every pet in the list of pet that is at Friend Impress or above.
** It also increases depending on [how many] sub quests have been cleared so far as well as other special event triggers. Some of these triggers increase the counter by 2 or more each.
** Jaldabaoth will not do anything in this phase. Attacking Jaldabaoth will bring the event to phase 4.

* In phase 4, whenever the player character does damage to Jaldabaoth, the counter will be decremented, but the damage will be increased by 5% of the maximum HP of the target.
** This will be a race to kill the target before the counter runs out.
** Damage dealt in this phase will not update the highest damage dealt record.
** For a list of Jaldabaoth's actions, see the phase 2 list. Defeating Jaldabaoth will start the ending.

* This event battle was balanced by taking into consideration how powerful the player character should be at this point.
** The difficulty is set such that players should be able to clear this event on the first try except for maybe phase 2.
** Even phase 2 should be manageable as long as the player has taken precautions against the debuffs, status ailments, and has sufficient elemental resistances. If the player also keeps the boss's power gauge low it gets even easier.
** If the player character dies during this battle, the player will have to start [the battle] over again.

* After the battle, Speed and Life upgrading with AP is no longer capped at 800 and 300 respectively.


===1.995: detailed changelog===
 [Skill groups that a day can have]
* Training-day
** Weight Lifting, Healing, Meditation, Magic Capacity, Heavy Armor, Medium Armor, Light Armor, Faith experience is tripled.

* Combat-day
** The 12 weapon skills, Tactics, Dual Wield, Two Hand, Shield, Evasion, Eye of Mind, Greater Evasion, Marksman experience is tripled.

* Jobs-day
** Negotiation, Investing, Carpentry, Tailoring, Alchemy, Jeweler, Gardening, Performing, Cooking, Fishing, Pickpocket experience is tripled.

* Exploration-day
** Stealth, Lock Picking, Detection, Mining, Disarm Trap, Traveling, Swimming, Riding experience is tripled.

* Study-day
** Literacy, Gene engineer, Anatomy, Analysis, Memorization, Casting, Magic Device, Control Magic experience is tripled.

* One of these groups is picked at random when the day changes.
* However, if the condition listed below has already been met for the selected group, it will attempt to pick a random group again, but only once.

 [The 7 DESTINY triggers]
* When the sum of experience earned for a group of skills by the player and all pets is above a threshold, +1 letter is gained for its corresponding group.
* The experience earned for a group is tripled when it's that group's day. Experience gained from Traveling is also counted, so these conditions are easily met if you have a lot of pets with high potentials but lots of room to grow. (This should be when the player lacks equipment the most.)
* Clearing at least 1 random Nefia grants +1 letter.
* Sleeping 3 times grants +1 letter.
* All conditions will be met eventually even if the player makes progress at a slow pace, unless it's a solo run and the player doesn't touch significant parts of the game. Which wouldn't be too bad either, since solo runs don't lack equipment as badly as large parties anyway.
* When all 7 letters in DESTINY are displayed in the top left corner and the player character enters a newly-generated random Nefia floor, a sound effect will play, "You felt destiny on this floor...!" will display, 3 Godly pieces of equipment will be placed on the tile with gold pieces in the current floor, and all triggers reset. This will not happen on floors that do not have the gold piece tiles.
* Grabbing these equips and clearing that Nefia while you're at it will cause the corresponding trigger to get activated again, as well as give debris for more skill experience.

 [Analysis counter mechanics]
* Counter increases by a greater amount when evading a regular attack than when getting hit by it. There is a cap of 100 on it.
* The higher the receiver's Analysis skill compared to the attacker's Analysis skill, the greater the increase in the counter.
* When counter is less than 100, it gives a small amount of Analysis skill experience. When counter is greater than 1, it gives a small amount of Memorization experience.
* However, Continuous attack, Knockout, Shadow rush, Fire a volley, and critical hits will not increase the counter.
* Analysis counter is shared by all allied characters.
* It would be weird for characters of different factions to share their analysis, so non-allied characters will not analyze.

 [New special actions]
* Advanced Casting
** Learned upon leveling up with Memorization skill level 10 or greater and Casting skill level 10 or greater.
** Use it to activate Adv-Cast status for the player character. Use it again to disable.
** When affected by Adv-Cast, casting difficulty and spell experience earned is tripled.
** It does not increase spell experience earned from magic practice.

* Data scan
** Learned upon leveling up with at least Analysis skill level 30. Gives a buff of the same name when used.
** When characters other than a character with the buff gets attacked, they will contribute more times to the analysis counter, making it go up quicker. However, the character with the buff will have his SP decreased by 2.
** When doing a regular attack, the effective accuracy and evade will also be displayed in the log while the buff is active.
** The accuracy will then be rolled against the evade. These values are not displayed for critical hits which are guaranteed to hit anyway or when the attack is evaded by special means.
** Using Data scan when the buff is active will get rid of the buff.
** When NPCs have the buff and the player uses it, the player character will be buffed and NPCs will have the buff removed.
** Of the existing NPCs, lothrian agent, metal zilla, <Melget> the informer, <Mobile Communication Equipment>, and doctor <Gavela> now use this special action. (Only if they are spawned in this version.)
** Pets with this will have a chance of using it when their SP is 80% or higher.
** When used by non-allied NPCs, they will not buff themselves, instead resetting the analysis counter for themselves to 0. They will have a chance to use it when the analysis counter is 50 or greater.


===1.99: detailed changelog===
 [New evolutions]
* talon soldier evolves into god talon soldier with god heart, and will receive +2 to their gauge every time they take damage.

* fin crocodile evolves into cipiltontli with god heart, and gains a low chance of using Bound in Blood when at less than 50% HP and is not currently buffed by Contingency.

 [New special action]
* Liquid Manipulation
** Learned during level up when Alchemy skill is 40 or greater and Control Magic skill is 30 or greater.
** Applies the effect of the selected potion on all enemies in sight. (Effect is slightly lower than using it directly on a single target.)
** Before applying the potion effect, it also deals user Alchemy and Control magic skill-dependent damage. Damage is reduced by target's PV and DV.
** When used by an NPC, it generates an uncursed and unblessed potion of paralysis in their inventory and uses the skill with it.
** <Beilgena> the artificial dragon, master archayeek, iris, profanity priest, oyaukamui, <Leiki>, meshera gamma, heqet, and <Ulzassil> will now use this. (But not if they were generated in a previous version of the game.)
** iris, profanity priest, and heqet have also been given a bonus to their Alchemy skill in order to use this skill.
** These characters now use Alchemical Rain: <Alfred> the cangnan wind, seiashin, cloudragon, and big sea hare. (But not if they were generated in a previous version of the game.)
 
 [New items]
* fishing introduction
** Self-explanatory title. Not randomly spawned.

* quest advice
** Self-explanatory title. Not randomly spawned.

* debris
** 3 are spawned when a random Nefia is cleared. Not found randomly spawned.
** Not spawned as clear rewards in the Void. When Wishing for it, a textbook will appear instead.
** The item name will indicate what skill it is for and its LV (level). The skill is determined by the Nefia boss's race. (Skills were assigned to races such that they all drop desirable skill debris; whether they fit the race's image or not was a secondary concern.) Level of the item (max 999) depends on the floor's danger level.
** Does not behave any differently when blessed or cursed. Cannot be used on non-pet NPCs.
** Cannot be used if the target does not have the corresponding skill, or if potential in that skill is below 50%.
** When used, it gives experience for the indicated skill. Amount of experience is based on the item's LV and the target's Memorization skill level (effect of the latter caps out at 1,000). It will also give item LV-dependent Memorization skill experience, and slightly increase insanity.
** These were added for to make clearing difficult Nefia more rewarding and to make Memorization skill useful for NPCs. Useful for training hard-to-level skills or giving newly-recruited pets a leg up.

** The 2nd to 4th will increase Impress by a slight amount if Impress is at Fellow or greater. The pet's reaction will change [in the Japanese version] depending on its style of speech. If the required level of Impress is not reached, these options will decrease it by a slight amount.
** The 5th to 7th options will increase Impress by a slight amount.
** The 8th to 10th will have a chance to cause confusion if Impress is at Fellow or greater. No other drawbacks.
** These are for roleplaying getting closer to your pets through daily conversation and not just by showering them with gifts, and for depicting your character's personality and attitude towards others. (This is why there are several options that have the same outcomes.) Also for depicting tsunderes in the relationship instead of the standard head-over-heels-for-each-other.

* <<Interest in a little tail t'night>>
** Usable only in evochat. Reduces the player's Action by 1 when selected.
** A counter increases or decreases depending on the options picked, and the player's and pet's SP will both decrease by random amounts.
** When the counter reaches 0, the pet's Happiness will increase by 3.
** Nothing will happen when cancelling before the counter reaches 0.
** txtMizuAsobi customizes the pet's response while this is in progress, and txtDialogH customizes the pet's reaction when the counter hits 0.

 [Means of transportation on the world map]
* Obtained by reading the deed (spawned randomly) for them. Nothing happens when the deeds are read by a non-player character.
** Only 1 of these can be owned at a time. Reading the deed for another type will overwrite the existing deed. (So as to prevent the player from swapping between vehicles for whichever fits the current needs.)
** When you own a vehicle, talking to a deed-selling NPC will bring up the option to get rid of the vehicle and go back to walking.
** When aboard any of these vehicles, the sprite and travelling sound effect will be changed, and pets you have with you will not be displayed. Dyeing the deed will dye the vehicle's sprite.
** The time taken to travel on the world map is reduced to 3/5, and you will be able to move [at regular speed] in the wilderness even when the cart is overloaded.

* deed of carriage
** Maintenance costs 500/month.
** Cargo limit is increased by 10 as long as you have this vehicle.

* deed of truck
** Maintenance costs 2000/month.
** Cargo limit is increased by 20 as long as you have this vehicle.
** When on a road tile, movement time is multiplied by another 3/5 (bringing effective movement time to 9/25 that of walking on foot).

* deed of magic locomotive
** Maintenance costs 10,000/month.
** Cargo limit is increased by 30 as long as you have this vehicle.
** Speed penalty when the cart is overloaded is halved. Will still not be able to move when overloaded by too much.
** No movement speed penalty on snow.
** Reduces player character's MP by a small amount for every tile travelled on the world map. However, will not cause damage or give Magic Capacity experience when MP goes negative.
** Expensive, so when wishing for this deed a deed of carriage will show up instead.
** If you have a custom item.bmp, note that it has been updated and now has the sprite for the side view of the carriage.

* deed of land battleship
** Maintenance costs 200,000/month.
** Speed penalty when the cart is overloaded is halved. Will still not be able to move when overloaded by too much.
** Cargo limit is increased by 100 as long as you have this vehicle.
** Immune to the desert heat. Completely prevents monster and rogue encounters, but does not prevent encounters with assassins, the chestnut giant, and wandering vendors.
** Also expensive, so wishing for this deed will cause a deed of carriage to show up instead.
** To illustrate its size, the sprite has been stretched horizontally, doubling its width.

** This does not directly cause crops to grow (if it did, there would be no point in using fertilizer).

** The number of turns of Disinfection buff is not affected by the cursed/blessed status of the disinfectant potion.
** It will prevent ranch animals from randomly getting sick, but it will not prevent any Sickness that spreads from within, such as from having a little tail and cursed potions.

** Servant-master relationship of all ranch animals increase.

* Consume disinfectant
** [Disinfect area]. Needs the aforementioned disinfectant. Increases Impress of all ranch animals.
** Alleviates Poisoned and Sick status of ranch animals by an amount dependent on cursed/blessed status of the potion.

** Also grants Blended lie when leveling up with 20 or greater Negotiation,
** Intimidation when leveling up with 30 or greater Negotiation, and
** Mysterious song when leveling up with 40 or greater Negotiation.

 [New special actions]
* All of these are 'W'ide-area special actions that cause 5 turns of auto-turn.
* They will also roll against every single every enemy in sight, every turn.

* Persuasion
** Rolls the sum of the user's Will and Negotiation against each target's Will.
** For rolls that succeed, it deals Will and Negotiation-dependent SP damage (reduced by target's Will) and reduces that target's power gauge by 10%.
** The lower the target's SP, the greater the damage, capping out at 5x.
** When the roll succeeds, there is a 5% chance of applying 1 turn of confusion regardless of resistance to that status ailment.

* Peculiar joke
** Rolls the sum of the user's Perception and Negotiation against each target's Perception.
** For rolls that succeed, it deals Perception and Negotiation-dependent SP damage (reduced by target's Perception) and reduces that target's power gauge by 10%.
** The lower the target's power gauge, the greater the damage, capping out at 2x.
** When the roll succeeds, there is a 2% chance of applying 1 turn of paralysis regardless of resistance to that status ailment.

* Blended lie
** Rolls the sum of the user's Dexterity and Negotiation against each target's Dexterity.
** For rolls that succeed, it deals Dexterity and Negotiation-dependent SP damage (reduced by the target's Dexterity) and reduces that target's power gauge by 10%.
** The lower the target's MP, the greater the damage, capping out at 10x.
** When the roll succeeds, there is a 5% chance of applying 1 turn of atrophy regardless of resistance to that status ailment.

* Intimidation
** Rolls the sum of the user's Strength and Negotiation against each target's Strength.
** For rolls that succeed, it deals Strength and Negotiation-dependent SP damage (reduced by the target's Strength) and reduces that target's power gauge by 10%.
** The lower the target's HP, the greater the damage, capping out at 10x.
** When the roll succeeds, there is a 2% chance of applying 1 turn of fear regardless of resistance to that status ailment.

* Mysterious song
** Rolls the sum of the user's Magic and Negotiation against each target's Magic.
** For rolls that succeed, it deals Magic and Negotiation-dependent SP damage (reduced by the target's Magic) and reduces that target's power gauge by 10%.
** The higher the target's power gauge, the higher the damage, capping out at 4x.
** When the roll succeeds, there is a 2% chance of applying 1 turn of paralysis regardless of resistance to that status ailment.

* None of these special actions will work while time is stopped.
* Targets will wake up if they were asleep or unconscious whether the roll succeeds or not.
* When a roll succeeds, a "!" bubble will be displayed, and a small amount of experience will be awarded to the Negotiation skill and the relevant attribute.
* When it fails, it'll display "?".
* SP damage is multiplied by 1/5 when used on uniques and bosses.
* Unlike the SP damage of Drain Blood, it can damage targets' SP even if it is already below 50.
* When lowering a target's SP to -100 or below (except for a target that is sandbagged) it will drop items and withdraw from battle if it is a regular NPC. No monster parts (NB: bone, blood, etc), corpse, and figure will be dropped.
* Because there is no karma reduction, NPCs like tourists won't drop wallets and ores.
* If the target is the player, a pet, a unique NPC, or [an NPC with a special conversation window like a shopkeeper], it will commit suicide, dropping monster parts, corpse, and figures.
* In all of the above cases, a smaller-than-usual amount of AP will be awarded to the user and the tag partner when appropriate.

* <Nancy> the wanderlust
** Level 30 zanan. (Race displayed is "dole".)

 [New item]

** Does not disappear when used.
** Can only be targeted at allies, and will apply the new Shooting Mode buff.
** Targets with that buff will be affected by Bind/Immobility, cannot move, and their SP will constantly decrease.
** However, their ranged attack damage calculations will now also take into account their equipment skill level, making it on par with wielding a heavy weapon two-hand.

 [New special action]
* Venotrate
** Learned upon level up when the player character has the researching poisons feat, Gene engineer skill level 50 or above, and Tactics skill level 20 or above.
** Does damage in a bolt spell AOE but will not hit friendly NPCs.
** Deals Gene engineer and Tactics-dependent damage, and poisons target even if they are immune to poison.
** Damage is reduced by the average of the target's PV and DV and not by poison resistance.
** If the target is a unique NPC, the poison status ailment afflicted is a fixed 2 turns. If not, it is 10 turns stacked upon the current number of turns remaining.


===1.86: detailed changelog===
 [New item]
* deed of property transfer deed

===1.85: detailed changelog===
 [New anniversary event]
* Making the pet happy increases Happiness by 10. Making it unhappy decreases Happiness by 5.
* No change if exasperated, and -10 if sad.
* The aforementioned are pretty inconsequential, but there is another option that triggers a special type of ragnarok where only universe invaders will spawn.
* All options except for ragnarok will generate a present at your character's feet.

 [New NPCs]
* kobold blaster
** Level 153 kobolt. Equipped with magnum ammo. Will occasionally use Collected Power.

 [New special actions]
* Hazard Recipe
** Learned upon level up by the player with the "researching poisons" feat acquired and at least 20 in the Gene engineer skill.
** Select a food item and it will gain a bit flag and the (Danger!) prefix. The item sprite will become jet-black, its item price will be reduced greatly, and it can no longer be used for having a meal together with a pet.
** It will still train attributes the same way the original food item did, but special effects [like gaining resistances and impregnation] will no longer work.
** Eating this item will cause the target to receive Gene engineer skill level-dependent non-elemental damage. If the target survives the damage, it will also get hit by one of the following:
*** vomit twice in a row,
*** have its gauge decreased by 30%, 
*** receive additional poison damage,
*** receive chaos damage,
*** roll for insanity,
*** roll to get dimmed, or
*** receive 2 turns of Invert status ailment.
** The epitome of lacing food with poison or a terminal inability to cook? You decide.

* Anaphylaxis
** 'W'ide special action.
** Learned upon level up by the player with the "researching poisons" feat acquired and at least 40 in the Gene engineer skill.
** Deals poison-element damage dependent on the user's Constitution attribute and Gene engineer skill, as well as the strength of the target's Poisoned status ailment.
** The target will receive damage even when not poisoned, but the damage multiplier will be low.
** Using this special action alone to poison a target will be difficult as the strength of the poison status ailment applied is low.
** If the target is poisoned, it inflicts Dyspnea status ailment. (Does not add additional turns of Dypsnea if the target is already afflicted by it.). It also rolls to dim the target and will cause vomiting.
** This special action works well with means of inflicting strong poison status ailment on targets such as Touch of Poison and bottles of poison.
** Won't work well on targets immune to poison status ailment.

 [New item]
* bomb barrel
** Made via item fusion. Not randomly generated and is a junk item.
** It explodes when destroyed by fire.
** Only up to 3 will explode/get destroyed by fire at a time even when stacked.

** Determination of whether the quota was met or not and thus if the quest is cleared happens when exiting the map.
** The reward is a fame-dependent number of platinum pieces and a point-dependent number of dark fragments (capped at 30).
** Exceeding 1.5 times the quota will also award a bronze coin.

** If evasion succeeds (whether by Evasion or Greater Evasion), it deals a low amount of Evasion skill-dependent damage to the attacker.
** It procs regardless of the distance between the attacker and the target. It also procs for every single hit of muti-hit attacks like Continuous attacks, but if the attacker dies before all hits are over, the target will take damage from the remaining hits.

** When targeting an adjacent tile with an NPC on it, it will splash onto that NPC, applying [Fury] and Wet status for a fixed 3 turns, stacking with the existing number of turns of Fury and Wet the NPC is already afflicted with.

 [New items]
* eruption painting
** Trade good generated only in Zaile.

* rabbit foot
** Trade good generated only in Zaile.

* urine
** The hydration version of vomit. One is generated when making a puddle.
** Has the same effect [as vomit] and comes prefixed with the creator's name.
** It's not "urine" in the Japanese version; it's another onomatopoeia to match vomit.
** It has a lower selling price than vomit. Unlike vomit, which only has a chance of getting generated when throwing up, urine is guaranteed to get generated whenever a character relieves itself.
** Why micturition has its own item instead of just creating a puddle:
*** so that people can collect it just like vomit,
*** potion puddles are perfectly circular and therefore not gross enough, and
*** potion puddles have a tendency of disappearing when the creator steps into it.

* ground bait
** Can be made with item fusion, but is also rarely randomly generated.
** Use when facing a water tile. If there uncooked fresh fish on that tile, it increases its +enhance value up to maximum of 15.
** NB: the item fusion recipe is named "mysterious diary".


===1.77: detailed changelog===
 [New NPCs]
* driceradops
** Level 140 dinosaur. Uses Melt Clinch, Homing Lazer, Acid Ground, Formless Fetter, and Pregnant (target will give birth to an alien).
* brontosaurus
** Level 78 dinosaur. Has lightning resistance. Uses Smash Ground, Lightning Bolt, and Charge Attack.
* triceratops
** Level 10 dinosaur. Neutral NPC. Uses Hyper Dash.

 [New special actions]
* <Unison Impact>
** Learned during level up when the player has 4 or more pets with him.
** For every friendly NPC in sight (includes non-pet NPCs) and the user, it takes the highest skill level out of the Tactics, Marksman, Casting, and Magic Device skills and multiplies it by that character's current power gauge. The resulting damage is dependent on the sum of that calculation for all those characters.
** Power gauge is then set to 0 for all the characters.
** This means that a character will add only half of its skill level to the sum if its gauge is 50%, and twice its skill level if its gauge is 200%. 
** If none of the characters have any of the required skills or if the sum is 0 after rounding, then the special action will fail.
** It will also fail if the NPC currently being targeted is not a hostile NPC.
** NPCs taking part in it will speak TxtSpecial if that custom line has been set for them.
** If the target is not sandbagged and does not have the bit flag for summoned NPCs, then all characters who took part in this special action will gain a bit of Tactics, Marksman, Casting, and Magic Device skill experience.
** Unlike gauge attacks, this does not have any additional effects, but its damaged cannot be reduced (e.g. by the target's skills), and the damage multiplier will always be the maximum instead of depending on the average +enhance value of all pieces of equipment.
** Pets set to Defense mode will also take part in it, and it's also a single attack so you won't contribute much to the combo counter even if you have a lot of pets.
** It has a full-screen animation, with a default size of 800*600 and scaled up to fit if the game window is larger.
** The default image file for the animation can be found in the user/graphic2 folder, and you can swap it out for something else if you like.
** If the damage is greater than the target's current HP, then it will also have an explosion visual effect.

* Group Hypnosis
** Learned during level up if you have the Hypnotism feat and a Control Magic skill level of 40 or greater.
** Attempt to put all enemies in sight to sleep if they are not already asleep.
** Strength of sleep is the user's illusion resistance, capped at 10 turns.
** If the user is a non-pet NPC, then it will also attempt to apply brainwash of a weaker strength than Eye of brainwashing to all targets who did not fall asleep.
** Of the existing characters, fallen angel, nightmare sheep, camouflaged imp, titania, and Exossil will now have a chance to use this if their target is neither asleep nor brainwashed.

* Thread of Innervation
** Learned during level up if the Strings Assassin feat has been acquired and Gene engineer skill level is 30 or above.
** When used on targets with more than 1/9 of their maximum HP, it will deal Gene engineer skill and Perception-dependent nerve damage.
** When used on targets with 1/9 or less of their maximum HP, it has a chance of instantly killing the target.
** It does not have a chance of instantly killing the target when its damage reduces the target's HP from above 1/9 of maximum to 1/9 of maximum or lower.
** Targets will not drop their corpse, figure, or monster parts, and instead drop their flesh doll.
** The flesh doll will be prefixed with the NPC's name and have a different sprite, but its item ID is that of a corpse, so this is not a new item.
** Like figures and cards, the flesh doll will not be tinted with the NPC's hue.
** It is considered a rank 10 meat dish. It will rot in 10 days, so you'll need to use a bottle of antiseptic on it to use it for decor.
** Of the existing characters, zombie queen, <Mary> the insect master, atlach-nacha, and meshera gamma now have it, but only if they were generated in version 1.77 or later.

 [New item fusion recipe]
* Meat-filling resuscitation
** Produces the aforementioned flesh doll.
** Its appearance will depend on the figure added, but its name and insides are those of the original corpse.

 [New item]
* bio battery
** Randomly generated, but shops will not sell it.
** Having it in the inventory will prevent changes to the holder's weight and height.

**** Sets the target's HP to 0 then deals 1 damage.
*** <Purge>
**** Wide-area special action that will work only on Purge mode.

** Can be targeted on adjacent tiles, but cannot be used on NPCs unless they have a master-servant relationship of 200 or more or a drug dependence of 100 or more.

 [Changes to items harvestable from unknown seeds]
* Please refer to the detailed changelog for 1.72.


===1.73: detailed changelog===
 [New items]
* painting of ehekatl and swordfish
** Can be purchased from <Manytia> the adventure merchant at the Old War Ground in Act III.
** Is not a precious item, so it can be wished for.
** Placing it in your home will prevent beggars, citizens, punks, Mysterious Producer, and adventurers with low impress from visiting.

* itzpalt's sculpture
** NB: Japanese name: bust of Itzpalt
** Can be purchased from <Manytia> the adventure merchant at the Old War Ground in Act III.
** Is not a precious item, so it can be wished for.

* yacatect's bank
** Can be purchased from <Manytia> the adventure merchant at the Old War Ground in Act III.
** Is not a precious item, so it can be wished for.
** Unlike the other items, this is a usable tool and not furniture.
** Unlike kitty banks, it will not get heavier with use.
** It can hold up to 1 billion gp.

 [Tobacco effects]
* suigara
** Creates a pillar of fire when thrown.
** Not affected by magatama, and is less powerful than a thrown molotov.
** Can be reused if the resulting pillar of fire doesn't burn it up.

* tobacco
** Using it removes the Distracted debuff. If +enhance value is greater than 10, it reduces tobacco dependence by (+enhance value - 10). e.g. a +15 tobacco will reduce dependence by 5.

* The below 4 items will all give a Perception and +enhance value-dependent Concentration buff.
** Tobacco dependence will increase by 100 minus the +enhance value.
** Using these will allow targeting of adjacent cells, but they cannot be used on non-pet NPCs.
** Increases satiety slightly if satiety is below Satisfied.
** When used by the player, it decreases sleepiness slightly if sleepiness is greater than 0 (but to a lesser extent than coffee).
** The number of times the player has smoked is recorded in the journal.
** Like tobacco, the prices of these items are also unaffected by +enhance value.
** cigarette: gives a decent amount of +enhance value-dependent Perception experience. Like in previous versions, a suigara will get generated at the character's feet after usage.
** hamaki: gives a decent amount of +enhance value-dependent Dexterity experience.
** tobacco pipe: gives a decent amount of +enhance value-dependent Learning experience.
** kiseru: gives a decent amount of +enhance value-dependent Charisma experience.

 [New debuffs]
* Distracted
** Resisting and removing this debuff becomes more difficult as tobacco dependence increases.

* Melancholy
** Resisting and removing this debuff becomes more difficult as drug dependence increases.

 [Hidden parameters]
* Tobacco dependence
** When not 0, the aforementioned Distracted debuff has a chance to get applied every random number of turns.
** The debuff will not get applied when on the world map, when already afflicted by Distracted, or when buffed by Concentration.
** Tobacco dependence is reduced by 1 when attempting to apply Distracted, regardless of whether the character succeeds or fails in resisting the debuff.
** As such, you could indefinitely stave off the debuff, but getting rid of the tobacco dependence later will be very difficult.

* Drug dependence
** When not 0, the aforementioned Melancholy debuff has a chance to get applied every random number of turns.
** The debuff will not get applied when on the world map or when already afflicted by Melancholy.
** Drug dependence is reduced by 1 and Sanity is increased by 1 when attempting to apply Melancholy, regardless of whether the character succeeds or fails in resisting the debuff.
** Whom dwell in the vanity is special in that his character is generated with a drug dependence of 1000, and his drug dependence will never go below 1.

 [New evolution]
* durahan (evolved from steel mass and living armor) evolves with king heart into lord armor.

 [New special action]
* Blame Pain
** Can be learned by hitting NPCs with a tamer's whip until their limit. Ranged attack.
** Deals nether damage dependent on the user's Will + Constitution 4 times, and applies 1 turn of Bind if target is not already bound.
** The user's Will + Constitution is also rolled against the target's, and if the user wins the roll, the target's power gauge will also decrease by 15.
** The first of the 4 attacks of this special action will work to increase the target's gauge, so the actual net change to the target's gauge will vary.
** Of the existing characters, Devastate Luluwy, Luluwy, Arasiel, and performaid pinchief will now use this.

 [Additional Act I content]
* Upon entering F20 and F25 of Lesimas: event in which zanan assassin will attack. Does not have to be defeated in order to proceed.
* Upon entering F30 of Lesimas: mid-boss battle with <Alsapia> the murderer mask. Has to be defeated in order to proceed.
* Upon entering F35 of Lesimas: event in which skeleton magician will attack. Does not have to be defeated in order to proceed.
* Upon entering F40 of Lesimas: mid-boss battle with <Gilphem> the magic steel. Has to be defeated in order to proceed.
* When all of the above events have been completed, Alsapia and Gilphem will be placed in Amur-Cage and can be spoken to.
* These events can still be triggered by even if Lesimas has already been cleared in a previous version the game. However, the have to be triggered in the same order as listed above.
* This is designed to bridge the gap for players who have completed the magic stone set, cleared the random floors up to F30, and defeated the level 28 Issizzle, but have yet to defeat level 55 Zeome on who comes after random floor F44.

 [New items]
* skill ticket
** Rarely randomly generated and cannot be sold. A junk item, not an ore.
** You can pay skill trainers with these instead of platinum pieces when learning a new skill.
** The option will appear on top of the regular one for platinum pieces if you have a skill ticket with you.
** The number of tickets the player will get in the salary is the number of times the player has levelled up since the previous salary. However, only up to a total of 9 tickets will be awarded for level ups. (i.e. 1 ticket per level up for a level 1 character until level 10.) No more will be awarded after that; potions of descent will not help.
** This is to reduce the need to farm platinum pieces in early game. This will work out to save a large number of pp. There is still the need to level up the character and get to the skill trainers alive, so it's not an outright reduction in difficulty. Skill tickets that you don't need can be inherited for use in the next character.

* mani's alarm clock
** Can be purchased from <Manytia> the adventure merchant at the Old War Ground in Act III.
** Not precious, so it can be obtained via wishing.

 [Crop yield groups]

* (Added soybean in 1.74.)

* March to May
** Vegetable: muskmelon, green pea, lettuce, quwapana
** Fruit: qucche, rainbow fruit, cherry
** Magic: rod of healing hands, rod of uncurse, rod of mana, rod of holy light, rod of speed, rod of cure, rod of heal, rod of cure minor wound
** Unknown: tea leaf, bannou mugi, random items

* June to August

===1.71: detailed changelog===
 [Act III main quest content]
* Head down to God's prison (the lowest floor of Cradle of Chaos) after the conversation with Leold for a cutscene.
* Defeating Enthumesis will place her in the centre of Amur-Cage.
* Take note that there is no way of reentering this floor after the battle at the moment; it will be possible in the future when more content is implemented.
* The floor is regenerated whenever the player enters it. Saving, praying, and Wishing is disabled on this floor to match the story.
* If you quaff water and a wish triggers, you won't feel a stoke of good fortune pass, i.e. the chances of getting another wish won't be reduced. However, using rods of wishing and the spell will decrease the charge, stock, and mp.
* Offerings to god may not be made nor can you change religion, but you can still catch signals from god. [Skill bonuses] from worshipping a god will also work.

 [New NPC]
* <Enthumesis>
** Level 350 god. Female bisexual by default.
** Has float bit flag and bonus chaos resistance. Eating her corpse will give chaos resistance.
** Uses Chaos Ball, Bubble Storm, Mind Bolt, Nether Wave, Multiple Gather, Regeneration, and Summon chaos.
** Uses Insult on low health (as a futile effort to stay alive - being outside of the area of effect of Insult is dangerous though).
** Drops god heart on death.

 [New evolutions]
* thief and robber evolve with another heart into gizoku (NB: chivalrous thief. Robin Hood?) and learn Golden Storm. Golden Storm has a low chance to be used when health is half or less of maximum health, and the NPC is currently carrying at least 2000 gold.
* puppet evolves with magic heart into battle puppet and learns Continuous attacks.
* fallen soldier evolves with king heart into indomitable general and learns Super Armor.
* nurse evolves with evolution heart into red cross and learns Rain of sanity. (There will only be a chance that this will be used when the NPC itself is insane. It is independent of the player character's insanity.)

 [New gauge attacks for each ammo type]
* magnum: Inverts the target for 2 turns if the target is not already Inverted.
* bullet: lowers PV (this is 75% as effective as Pulverization).
* energy cell: line attack. Blinds target for 2 turns if target is not already blinded for more than 2 turns. Colour of the visual effect depends on the element that the user has the most resistance against.
* bolt: Paralyzes target for 2 turns if target is not already Paralyzed for more than 2 turns. Also has a chance to decapitate.
* arrows: 3x3 tile area-of-effect attack. Applies 2 turns of Wince if target is not already Wincing.

 [New materials]
* Good paper
*  Durable cloth
* Log
* White weed

 [Items now craftable with sewing kit]
* fur carpet (Tailoring 40)
* luxury sofa (Tailoring 25)
* coldproof blanket (Tailoring 17)
* fireproof blanket (Tailoring 15)
* dress (Tailoring 12)
* variety of clothes (Tailoring 3)
* decorated cloth (Tailoring 1)
Note: made changes to the sprites for dress and decorated cloth so that their height sort of matches up.

 [Changes to materials used in crafting]
* shaved ice: reduced Ice stone, removed Generator
* potion of salt solution: reduced Seawater
* potion of restore spirit/restore body: removed Hot water
* potion of healer <Jure>: removed Medicinal weed, added Holy weed

* noble toy (trade goods): removed Fine stone, added Howling weed
* coffin (trade goods): removed Thick wood, added Log
* barrel (trade goods): removed Branch, added Log

 [New items]
* <God Binder>
** Equipped by the aforementioned Enthumesis. This is to lower her stats as a handicap. Like other claws, it is a shield that doesn't actually function as a shield.

The items listed below are craftable from materials. They are not randomly generated. You can sell them if you accidentally make too many.
* soft high materium
* soft materium
* hard high materium
* hard materium
* sharp high materium
* sharp materium

These will work on different types of equipment (they won't work on unique artifacts):
* Soft: 36 equipment types including soft armours, composite stuff (NB: includes large shield), and whips
* Hard: 39 equipment types including metal armours and firearms
* Sharp: 32 equipment types including bladed weapons, clubs, claws, feather, bows, and ammos
* Too many items would have fallen under the 'hard' category, so some items were grouped under 'sharp' in a rock-paper-scissors approach to the classification.
* You can check which category an equipment type belongs to by looking at the required ingredients in item fusion.

 [New item fusion recipes]
* harmful potion
* log house
* equip making (3 types)
** Makes artifact equipment of the same type as the equipment used as the ingredient. Material is random.
** This recipe will produce two of expensive items like the speed ring, panty, aurora ring, seven league boots, and vindale cloak.
** Only one sox will be produced because it's expensive and it's also used in a quest.
** The recipe will produce 3 of all other equipment types.
** The game will auto-save.

* equip update (3 types)
** The equipment type of the piece of equipment used as the ingredient will be changed to another one in the same category.
** All equipment attributes including those intrinsic to the equipment type will be conserved.
** The price and material will also not change. The stats and weight will be those of the new equipment type.
** This can be used to preserve the equipment attributes while changing equipment type to a better one. You could also change equipment to a type that has a better intrinsic equipment attribute or sell price, then use it in the equip making recipe.
** Non-sox equipment cannot be turned into sox.
** This is available in early game, but it's rather expensive in terms of materials. Being rich can somewhat help though.
** As for the actual equipment class changes:
*** bullet -> magnum -> energy cell -> bullet -> [loop]
*** arrow -> bolt -> arrow -> [loop]
*** engagement amulet -> bejeweled amulet -> neck guard -> peridot -> engagement amulet -> [loop]
*** charm -> talisman -> decorative amulet -> charm -> [loop]

*** small shield -> round shield -> shield -> knight shield -> large shield -> claw -> kite shield -> tower shield -> small shield -> [loop]
*** short bow -> long bow -> skull bow -> short bow -> [loop]
*** repeating bow -> crossbow -> ballista -> repeating bow -> [loop]
*** pistol -> machine gun -> shot gun -> sniper rifle -> laser gun -> pistol -> [loop] 
*** stone -> rock -> grenade -> shuriken -> panty -> stone -> [loop]
*** hand axe -> battle axe -> bardish -> hand axe -> [loop]
*** sox -> club
*** club -> hammer -> club -> [loop]
*** katana -> lightsabre -> long sword -> claymore -> katana -> [loop]
*** spear -> trident -> halberd -> spear -> [loop]
*** kitchen knife -> dagger -> scimitar -> wakizashi -> kitchen knife -> [loop]
*** chainsickle -> sickle -> scythe -> chainsickle -> [loop]
*** staff -> long staff -> whip -> staff -> [loop]
*** Note: there are several instances of equipment changing into a different hard/soft/sharp type.


===1.70: detailed changelog===
 [New Act III sub quest]
* Start by talking to Arasiel. When the date changes, there is a 5% chance that the target monster you need to capture will change to a different one.
* When the target monster is turned in, there will no longer be a target monster specified.
* If there is no target monster specified when the date changes, there is a 50% change that there will be a new target monster specified.
* Pets not marked as important will be handed over [without any confirmation]. Pets in a tag team cannot be turned in.
* Handing over 3 target monsters will clear the quest the first time, and will award only the Rainbow.
* When repeating the quest, you will have to turn in 5 monsters each time to receive a reward. The reward that is given depends on the time at which you talk to Arasiel:
** :00 - :07 for jewel of tear of god for the deals fire damage equipment attribute
** :08 - :15 for jewel of tear of god for the deals cold damage equipment attribute
** :16 - :23 for jewel of tear of god for the deals lightning damage equipment attribute

** Granted by the potion of gem and spellbook of gem below.

 [New items]
* potion of gem
** Generated randomly.

* spellbook of gem
** Generated randomly.

* high potion of wisdom
** Available only via item fusion. Not generated randomly. Has the effects of Hero, Gem, Concentration, and Divine Wisdom, but at a lower strength than if all those potions had been used separately.

* soybean
** Low chance of being randomly generated. Food item that does not rot.
** When thrown, is used up and deals Throwing skill-dependent dark elemental damage. Status ailment strength is dependent on +enhance value. Is used up even if it hits an empty tile.
** If the target that it hits is a shine ogre, slash ogre, or smash ogre, it deals non-elemental damage like when salt hits a snail.
** Is used to make bottles of soy sauce and the 3 items below in item fusion.

* fried tofu
** Low chance of being randomly generated. Food item that does not rot. Trains Magic when eaten.
** When fed to a fox, fox brother (and evolved fox brothers), and silver fox brother, it increases Happiness by 5 if Happiness is less than 5.
** Inherits the +enhance value of the soybean ingredient.

* tofu
** Low chance of being randomly generated. Food item that does not rot. Trains Strength when eaten.
** When thrown, is used up and deals Throwing and +enhance value-dependent fixed damage. Gives a special death message. Is used up even if it hits an empty tile.
** Inherits the +enhance value of the soybean ingredient.

* natto
** Low chance of being randomly generated. Food item that does not rot. Trains Dexterity when eaten.
** When thrown, it afflicts (+enhance value + 5) turns of Fury that does not stack. You may want to use these in conjunction with Charge Attack or something.
** Inherits the +enhance value of the soybean ingredient.

* 1.2 million tax certificate

* 12 million tax certificate
** These two items are available for sale only in certain places like the embassy, and depositing them in the tax box will deduct the amount indicated from the gold pieces you currently have.
** Taxes you incur each month will be deducted from the amount that you have pre-paid, and you will not receive any bills when there is a balance remaining.
** Taxes deducted from the pre-paid amount will be exempt from the 0 - 19% random additional charge that is applied to bills, making it cheaper to pre-pay taxes.
** Balance remaining is displayed in the journal.
** If tax exceeds the remaining balance, you will be billed only the difference. When the balance runs out, a message will be displayed.
** You can pre-pay with as many tax certificates as you like; each certificate will add to the remaining balance.
** Be careful with these if you are trying to get your taxes in arrears to join the Thieves Guild.

* <Harakiri>
** Reusable unique artifact. Not a weapon.
** Randomly generated, and has a rare-loot trigger dependent 1/30 chance of dropping from kamikaze samurai.
** If used, you will commit seppuku, setting HP to 1/8 of the current value and causing bleed. All characters in sight (including unique NPCs) will then cease to be in combat mode. NPCs that were not originally hostile will no longer be hostile, and hostile NPCs will overlook you for 15-50 turns and will not have discovered you yet.
** Duels will also end.
** This means you can escape from combat, or heal up and stab characters in the back.
** The disadvantages of using this are significant, but you can pair it with the Blood Stream attack below to deal a large amount of damage.
** Be warned, however, that using the Harakiri again in sight of NPCs currently overlooking you (including pets) will proc kaisyaku, i.e. decapitation to help with the suicide.

 [New special actions]
* Blood Stream
** Learned during level up when Will and Constitution are both 50 or above.
** Deals Will and Constitution-dependent damage in a straight line. Reduced by PV + DV.

===1.69: detailed changelog===

* Cutscene when entering any floor of the Cradle of Chaos. Added a conversation with Leold. No new floors added.

 [New special actions]
* Formless Fetter
** Learned during level up when Control Magic skill is level 60 or above.
** All enemies in sight that are on any map effect (including floating enemies) will have 1 turn of Bind applied to them (Bind does not stack), and be dealt Magic attribute and Control Magic skill-dependent magic element damage.
** Targets that are non-unique NPCs and have Dexterity that is less than half of of the user's Dexterity will also have a Control Magic skill level-dependent Dexterity debuff applied to them.

* Melt Clinch
** Applies 1 turn of Bind to the user and the target, and also 1 turn of Atrophy to the target. Neither of these status ailments stack.
** It will also deal a small amount non-reducible acid-element damage to targets that is dependent on the user's Strength and Constitution attributes.
** The slimenoid and slimeroper [evolutions] (NB: no English names?) will now use this move.

 [New NPCs]
* dragon bubble

* Bubble and blue bubble will evolve with another heart into bobble bubble, and learn Bubble Storm. They will also learn Casting and Control Magic skills, and gain additional levels in those skills.

 [New items]
* cheese
** Food item that does not rot.
** When crafted via the Dairy products item fusion recipe, it will inherit the +enhance value of the milk used as the ingredient unlike the two items below.
** NPC name will not be inherited.

* butter
** Food item that does not rot. Can be thrown.
** Targets hit by it will get the Oil status ailment, and have a minor corpse seasoning effect applied to them (upper limit +2).

** Like tomatoes, they will disappear without creating puddles when thrown at the ground.

* yogurt

** Randomly generated unique artifact. Wings.

 [Shopkeeper feats]
* TraitElegance
** Increases Charisma by 30 when acquired.
** Increases the amount of money that visitors to your shop carry by 75% and 2,000. This does not apply to NPCs that are generated with 0 gold.

* TraitAestheticSense
** When trading items, items are worth 33% + 300gp more.

* TraitProprietarySales
** Gold pieces equal to 5 to 10 times of Negotiation skill will be placed in the shop's safe every day. This is independent of item sale in the shop. No upper limit.
** This sum will be capped at 1 when the player is in the Deep-sea castle.
** This trait will have no effect if the pet with it is not the shopkeeper. Gold pieces earned in this manner will not award any sales experience, shop rank, or experience.
** Item sale prices cap out at about 160 Negotiation, so this trait makes gaining Negotiation skill levels beyond that useful.
** As a side note, the player's Negotiation skill effect caps out at 100 and there is currently no merit to level it beyond that, but special actions dependent on it will be added in the future.

* TraitTie-up
** When this pet is with the player, when [the pet] sells items, half of the player's Negotiation is added to the pet's.
** Ores and wild flowers sell for 1.5x the usual price for pets.
** Neither of these two effects stack when multiple pets have the trait.

* TraitBusiness Smile
** The shopkeeper learns Bewitch special action. This does nothing if the pet does not participate in combat, of course.
** The pet will use Bewitch if the target still has Attract and is not currently Paralyzed.
** Due to the nature of this move, pets with AIs that like to maintain a distance from targets will not be able to use it.

 [New map tiles]
* Rope divider floor tiles, listed after the music tiles.

* Showcase transparent wall tiles, listed after the red flesh walls. A version that does not connect with other tiles has also been added.

* These can be used for decorating around items in your home.

* In the shop, items that are on top of these tiles will be marked as not for sale.

* After mining a tile or redecorating the shop, all items that are on these tiles will be marked as not for sale, and items not on these tiles will have that marker removed.

* Items that have been marked as not for sale will have "sample" prefixed to the item name, and will never be sold.

* When attempting to pick up these sample items, the not-for-sale marker will be removed (even if you fail to pick them up).

* This means that if floor tiles are destroyed or overwritten in the shop by means other than mining or redecorating, sample items will remain that way. To fix that, you will have to pick them up, go into redecorating mode, or mine something.

* This new item marker was created because the game cannot check which items are on which tiles when the player is not on the shop map.


===1.68: detailed changelog===
 [Additional main quest content]
* Cutscene when entering the library, right up to the part where you talk to Sophia to receive yellow gem stone of Heart of twilight.
** The game will remember which reward you picked, and change the lines that [Sophia] speaks in the default conversation accordingly.
** It's kind of like how Orphe said in Act I that the Origin of Vice would no longer update when it's not on the pedestal, and elona players would probably think of taking the entire pedestal with them.

 [New NPCs]
* sin gorilla - level 155 largeanimal. MP Breath, Power Breath, Fire Breath, Homing Lazer.
* ganesa - level 134 largeanimal. Smash Ground, Continuous attacks.

** Drinking it will reduce Fear, Poisoned, Confused, Dim, and Paralyzed status ailments by an amount dependent on the +enhance value.
** It will also slightly reduce body weight by an amount dependent on the +enhance value. This is a healthy way of losing weight without puking.

* black tea
** Tea recipe will produce two of these if the ingredient is blessed. Product will inherit +enhance value of tea leaf ingredient. It is also randomly generated.
** Drinking it will recover 5 sp and (+enhance value + 5)% max MP.

* livestock feed
** Craftable from mix feed recipe, and inherits the +enhance value of the food used as the ingredient. Rarely randomly generated. Eating it will increase body weight by an amount dependent on the +enhance value.
** Body weight increases from eating livestock feed is not subjected to the character height limit.
** You can hand these to livestock that are not fully sated, upon which they will be immediately consumed.
** This is for recycling food items that are cheap but have an +enhance value or are unsellable and also fattening livestock. It can also help get rid of that bony figure.

* yellow gem stone of Heart of twilight
** Allows you to change the danger level of unentered random Nefia within range of sight to 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.1, 1.3, or 1.5 times and makes them have 4 floors. This effect can be applied multiple times to a Nefia.

 [Effect of etherwind on Meshera NPCs]
* Meshera NPCs refers to the 7 bacteria NPCs and Regulus.
* Maps where this effect will be constantly applied are the Mountain Pass and the Ancient Garden.
* The higher the NPC's Constitution attribute, the greater the HP deduction.

 [Adding equipment attributes with Garok's hammer]

===1.67: detailed changelog===
 [Additional main quest content]
* Talking to Leold on F39 of the Cradle and selecting the option will bring you to the Tezcatlipoca battle. Two talon soldiers will also spawn, but they will disappear when Tezcatlipoca is defeated. There is a conversation with Leold after you win. Next update will add a cutscene after moving to another map.

 [New NPCs]
* <Tezcatlipoca>
** Level 200 god. Floats.
** Uses Distant Attack, Dimensional Move, Eye of Illusion, and Attribute.
** Has the special ability to nullify smokescreens during its turn.
** NB: Japanese name lit. Night Smoke Tezatlipoca.

* fin crocodile
** Level 8 servant. Floats.
** Uses Water Bolt and Alchemical Rain. Voracity Fang on low health.
** Comes with Swimming skill. Has the special ability that multiplies the speed bonus from Swimming by 1.5 times. Sprite is the same for males and females. Will be able to evolve in future versions.

* talon soldier
** Level 8 servant. Floats.
** Uses Hero, Regeneration, and Provoke.
** Has the special ability to nullify smokescreens during its turn. Sprite is the same for males and females. Will be able to evolve in future versions.

* black hopper X
** Level 157 beetle. Forms swarms, floats, and has temper bit flag.
** Uses Power Breath, Scavenge, and Voracity Fang.

* assault red dragonfly
** Level 136 beetle. Forms swarms and floats. Uses Clash Rush.

 [New evolution]
* caterpillar sniper evolves with god heart into god moth. Will use Draw Shadow if its target is not adjacent to it. Gains ability to use Punishment. Glows. Does not gain float bit flag.

 [New special actions]
* Curtain of Smoke
** Learned during level up when Stealth skill is level 20 or above. A wide-area skill.
** It generates a smokescreen map effect centred around the user.
** Tiles with smoke on them will reduce range of sight. Smoke disappears with the passage of turns. Like other map effects, they can be overwritten.
** Ball and bolt spell areas of effect will also be reduced by the smoke, but they will be able to clear the smoke effect within that AoE even if they are not water-type spells.
** Breath-type attacks will not be affected at all, and will [also be able to remove the smoke effect].
** Sense Object will make it transparent.
** Use this when you want to run away or put some distance between you and your target, as it hinders attacks that depend on range of sight like spells, ranged attacks, and Shadow Step. This will not prevent enemies from chasing you down though.
** The following existing NPCs will gain this special action: red ninja, new citizen, and <Eila>the fugitive Kunoichi. They will have a chance of using it if their target is 2 or more tiles away and there is no smoke on the tile they are standing on.

* Smoke Mirror
** Gauge attack for Tezcatlipoca. Will not be used when recruited as a pet.
** Places 200 (which is the limit) smokescreen map effects on the map.
** Will also buff the user with Black Mirror, a new buff. This will cause each of the user's attributes ranging from Strength to Magic to become the average of their original values and the player's corresponding attributes. This means that the user will become weakened in most cases. You can also deliberately lower your attributes when fighting Tezcatlipoca. If the player is way too strong, this will help make it a bit of a challenge.
** Based on its usefulness relative to the attacks of other gods and its cosmetic purpose, gauge consumption has been set to 50%. This gauge attack will be used most of the time, leaving little to no chance of weapon gauge usage.

 [New items]
* <Yohualli Tezcatl>
** Small shield unique artifact equipped by Tezcatlipoca. Will drop.

* craft repair kit
** Randomly generated consumable. Use it on a target piece of equipment (will work on ammos but not unique artifacts) to change their stats to the upper limit for their material.

** High spawn rate so that you can use these on pet equipment as well.

* ohuda
** Randomly generated junk item.
** When thrown at a target, will deal magic damage dependent on Throwing and Magic Device skill levels. Will also remove buffs, so there's only one difference between this and Megid Flame.
** It's not a rod/spellbook/scroll, but magic shops will stock these.
** NB: paper talisman.

* lovely bouquet
** Not randomly generated, but craftable with item fusion.
** Increases impress when given to targets that are at Fellow or above. Targets below Fellow will still accept the bouquet, but there will be no increase in impress.

* bio printer
** Randomly generated consumable. Yields the figure of the target NPC without killing it.

* stardust
** Extra copies of unique artifacts will turn into this. Not randomly generated. Consumable.

** Salary will pay 1 of these if your taxes are not in arrears.
** Quartermaster feats will give an additional 1 whether your taxes are in arrears or not, even for Apprentice Quartermaster.
** Will not be given as salary when in the Deep-sea castle.
** Has the following uses:
*** Upgrading your cart. It had been changed from small medals to platinum pieces but it was still too expensive.
*** Training the shopkeeper in your shop. It used to cost money, but it was kind of weird that you spent money to earn money in the shop.
*** Ordering the special dish at inns. Gives an attribute growth buff to the player and all pets in sight who are able to not incapacitated (NB: not asleep, etc). Will become Satisfied if satiety is below Satisfied.
** Will have more uses and ways of obtaining these in the future.

 [Flowers that bloom in the wilderness]
* Name and appearance will change with the month in which they are generated.
** January - daffodil
** February - margaret
** March - dandelion
** April - tulip - default colour will be picked at random from 3 colours.
** May - rose - default colour will be picked at random from 3 colours.
** June - hydrangea - default colour will be picked at random from 3 colours.
** July - lily
** August - sunflower
** September - marigold
** October - cosmos
** November - chrysanthemum
** December - primula
** Like fishes obtained from fishing, these will all [have the same item ID]. 
** They are a type of furniture, will come with prefixes, and their material can be changed.
** They have a high chance of getting generated. They will not display as rawwork when made of raw.
** They sell for a decent price, and when handed to pets they will sell them just like ores.
** Pets will not pick up flowers and can be asked to return them to you.
** They may have an +enhance value when harvested from unknown seed crops that will increase their price, so you could probably roleplay a florist or a flower selling girl.
** Throwing roses will not deal weight-dependent damage, but will instead cause bleed damage dependent on their +enhance value, so you can have fun with these.
** And of course, you can use these to decorate your properties.

 [New equipment attribute]
* It allows quick shooting.
** Ranged weapons will rarely come with this. Pistols and short bows have a higher chance of having it.
** When hit by regular ranged attacks (including throwing ones), the wielder will deal a small amount of unmitigable damage dependent on Marksman skill on the attacker before the attack hits. 2 turns of Wince will also be afflicted on the attacker.
** Will not activate when affected by Blind, Sleep, Paralyzed, Unconscious, or time stop, and also when sandbagged.
** Will not work against Zero shoot and Fire a volley.
** Will work only against the first attack of extra ranged attacks, rapid ammos, and burst ammos.
** Characters that will have this as a bit flag are gunfish, archayeek gunner, <Milis> the soldier, requiem, and chaos hunter. (Will also work for existing characters after their stats are recalculated.)

 [Bonus experience]
* If the parameter that gains experience is equal to or greater than the Speed part of INIT + 100, then it will gain bonus experience. The lower the attribute + Life/Mana part of INIT, the greater the bonus.
** This bonus is added before the reduction based on the current value of the parameter and the various multipliers.
** The idea here is to prevent characters from growing extremely quickly when starting off, and to alleviate the stagnation in growth in late-game.
** This will also help out character that have low starting speed and relatively fewer chances to level attributes and skills.

 [Somewhere in South Tyris...]
* Added an option to the conversation with Maile in the Oblivion Palace.
** This will halve attributes and skill levels of the target character that are 50 or above. (Minimum is 50.) If level is 50 or above, then it will also be halved.
** This is repeatable, so you can lower stats until you're satisfied. Be careful though, as characters that start off with stats that are below 50 may have their INIT increased instead.
** This can mess things up, so unlike the other options, selecting this option will not auto-save the game.
** Like the other options, the error message is purely cosmetic.

 [Adding body parts with Gavela]
* Cost for pets is a lot lower than for the player, except for torso parts as they are unobtainable from regular gene engineering.

 [Additional notes about rare item spawning]
* If a new month or year starts after loading a game, then the rare drop trigger will [also] be turned on on the 1st of the month at 0:10am.
** It's set this way because a day can be defined as 1440 minutes, but months and years have variations that make them impossible to be defined as a constant.
** Another idea I had was to disable the trigger for 10 minutes after every game save, which would also work against [item farming] using backups of save files. However, that wasn't implemented and this trigger will turn off only when loading saves the regular way [after exiting the game without playing more than 10 minutes the last time]. After all, people who tinker with the save data outside the game would probably find it faster to just edit the game memory.

 [Note]
* Mechanics for item spawning and rerolling are listed at the bottom of this file.
** It's pure game data, so if you want to keep things a surprise and avoid spoilers you may not want to see it.
** I can't recommend looking at it unless you don't like the element of randomness or are interested in how things work.

===1.65: detailed changelog===
 [Additional main quest content]
Cutscene on F39 of Cradle of Chaos and placed Leold there. Ends with the conversation for now.

 [Tutorial facility]
* the Adventure Seminar
** [NPCs on this map] will resurrect naturally with time and map will refresh periodically. The Classroom map accessible from here will refresh whenever you enter it. The courses overlap in content, but another way of looking at it is that there is continuity across the courses.

 [New NPCs]
* novice

* <Part time worker> the red sword
** Level 55 karune. Drain Blood, Squeeze, Draw Shadow.

 [New evolutions]
* Chaos spirit evolves into chaos sprout with evolution heart. Male and female sprites differ.
* Using a god heart on chaos sprout will then make it evolve into chaos plant and learn Extermination Breath.

 [Birthday event]
* Up to 16 NPCs out of all the pet and non-pet NPCs on the current map will now be selected (pets will have priority) and they will celebrate your birthday.
* They will celebrate it even if they were out of sight, have low impress, or are hostile, but not if they are asleep, unconscious, or have 0 Attract.
* Lines spoken by them will be affected by their respective styles of speech.
* The number of NPCs there and the options [you pick] will determine whether they will cheer and applaud.
* The worst thing that can happen is that there is no one on the current map. In that case, the wish goddess will celebrate your birthday.
* A blessed present will be generated at your feet when the event ends.

 [Milking livestock]
* The +enhance value of milk produced by livestock will be higher if they are good at producing milk. Being inept at producing milk will have no effect on the resulting +enhance value.
* Milking has the same cooldown as Rubbing them with a brush. However, livestocks' Life will be halved every time they are milked.
* Attempting to milk livestock with less than 2 Life will kill them. Livestock will still spawn milk on the ranch even when their Life has been lowered, so you can choose whether you want to milk them all you can then let them live or turn them into pieces of meat afterwards.


===1.64: detailed changelog===
 [Additional main quest content]

** Grants Aromageddon special action upon level up when Gardening is 60 or above.

 [New special action]
* Misteltein
** Deals Throwing skill-dependent damage to the target's mana.
** There are a couple of things that make this different from other mana damage-dealing special actions.
** If the target is not a unique NPC and Strength is half or more than the user's base Strength, then a Strength debuff dependent on Gardening skill will be applied.

===1.63: detailed changelog===

 [Additional main quest content]
* Placed the below mentioned Alfred on F34. Generates with half health and is Unconscious by default. If Lankata was killed, he will automatically recover from unconsciousness and you can talk to him. Otherwise, you will have to bash him to talk to him. You will be able to progress in the main quest even if you ignore him.
** The main quest branches are as follows:
**# If you talk to Alfred with Lankata killed -> Alfred will be placed in Amur-Cage after the conversation.
**# If you talk to Alfred without killing Lankata and without killing all 4 of the undead bosses -> Alfred will be placed in Amur-Cage after the conversation. Lankata will be moved from F25 to F34 if not dead, and will naturally resurrect with time on F34 when killed.
**# If you talk to Alfred without killing Lankata but have killed all 4 of the undead bosses -> Alfred and Lankata both move to the Shrine of Guardian after the conversation.
**# If you go to the next floor without talking to Alfred -> Alfred dies when you use the stairs, and will be placed in Amur-Cage. When reentering F34, Lankata will be moved to that floor from F25 if not dead, and will naturally resurrect with time on F34 when killed.
**# If Alfred dies before the conversation -> when reentering F34, Lankata will be moved to that floor from F25 if not dead, and will naturally resurrect with time on F34 when killed.
** #3 is the only scenario where both of them get to live, but no matter which you pick there won't be any difference in the items that you can obtain or anything. Just pick the one that suits your character the best.

* Cutscene on F35.
* Placed <Aile> the attendant on F36.
* F37 is inaccessible for now.
* The Cradle of Chaos has 40 floors in total.

 [New item]

** Unique battle axe artifact. Is equipped by the aforementioned Alfred.

 [New feats]
* Zin-ba
** NB: pun on "one with the steed".
** With this, accuracy penalty for weapons weighing 4s or more is reduced from
*** (Weapon weight - 3.6) * 1000 / (10 + Riding skill / 5) to
*** (Weapon weight up to 10s - 3.9) * 1000 / (100 + Riding skill * 2).
** In addition to the above, the negative accuracy modifier while riding will also be reduced from
*** 100 / (150 - Riding / 2, min. 115, max. 150) to
*** 100 / (150 - Riding / 2, min. 105, max. 125).
** The accuracy penalty for weapons weighing 4s or more equipped on the steed is also reduced from
*** (Weapon weight - 3.6) * 1000 / (10 + Strength / 10) to
*** (Weapon weight up to 10s - 3.9) * 1000 / (100 + Strength).
** The negative accuracy modifier for the steed while riding will be reduced from
*** 100 / (150 - Strength / 2, min. 115, max. 150) to
*** 100 / (150 - Strength / 2, min. 105, max. 125).

* Sexy Dance
** NB: Reads "Gravity Control" in Japanese.
** Replaces the Tough feats. Gives the Gravity Accel special action.
** Will give Gravity Sphere special action when leveling up with 60 or more Constitution.
** Will also give the Giga Gravitation special action when leveling up with 100 or more Constitution.

 [New special actions]
* Gravity Accel
** Applies a buff of the same name to all allies (including the user) in visual range. When activated, targets will gain +20 turns of Gravity status ailment. While active, affected targets will not activate traps, nor step into puddles, nor fall into wells even though they are afflicted by Gravity. Physical damage dealt is increased by 10%, and physical damage received is reduced by 5%.
** Speed increases with the number of turns of Gravity status ailment, capped at 1/2 of the target's original speed or 300, whichever is lower.
** While the buff is active, the "you generate gravity" ether disease symptom is negated.
** Gravity status ailment from Gravity special action lasts for +50 to 99 turns which is longer, so you may find Gravity Accel better when used in conjunction with the [Gravity special action].
** In essence, this reduces the negative effects of Gravity on allies and also applies positive effects to it.
** Gravity status ailment will still completely negate Greater Evasion though.

* Giga Gravitation
** Applies +30 turns of Gravity status ailment to all enemies in visual range and +1 turn of Bind.
** Deals magic-element damage dependent on the user's Constitution and Magic Capacity skill level.
** Damage is multiplied by 1.5x if the target's Gravity status ailment has 50-99 turns remaining.
** Damage is multiplied by 2x if the target's Gravity status ailment has 100-149 turns remaining.
** Damage is multiplied by 2.5x if the target's Gravity status ailment has 150-199 turns remaining.
** Damage is multiplied by 3x if the target's Gravity status ailment has 200 or more turns remaining.
** This special action is a lot more powerful when used in conjunction with the Gravity special action.
** Gives Magic Capacity experience after using.

* Hyper Dash
** Learned during level up if Riding skill is 80 or above.
** Nothing happens if used while not riding/being ridden.
** Effect is applied to the player if used by the steed the player is riding, or if used by the pet riding the player.
** If used by the player when the player is not riding, the below mentioned effects do not occur.
** The character controlling movement (or the tag partner of an NPC) will be able to displace enemies from their tile with this buff.
** When the player is under the effect of this buff, a melee attack will not occur when moving in the direction of an enemy and the enemy will get displaced.
** Shadow Step and Distance Attack can still be used. Select the appropriate option from the 'i'nteract menu to use melee attacks.
** Be aware that NPCs will not attempt to push away an enemy standing between them and their target.
** Inflicts 1 turn of Wince. Damage is reduced by the average of the target's PV + DV + Dexterity.
** The character controlling movement will gain Riding skill experience. (Also given to the player's steed/rider, and to tag partners of NPCs.)
** This is basically a hit-and-run attack.
** Divine cattle and unicorn NPCs from evolution will now have this special action.

 [New gauge attack]
* Graviton Buster
** Activated by Gravity Sphere. Destroys wall and floor tiles in a breath area of effect.
** Targets will gain +50 turns of Gravity status ailment and a Slow debuff that is stronger than that of Gravity Sphere. Damage is not reduced by Feather.
** Power depends on the average of the user's Constitution and the floor number (max of 2000).

 [New evolution]
* Large bike will evolve with machine heart into machine storm and learn Hyper Dash.

 [Changes to an existing evolution]
* Xeren electric tank which was already strong to begin with will no longer evolve. Xeren auto tank added in this version will evolve into Xeren humanoid tank. Attribute increased by evolution has been changed from Magic to Strength. Fire a volley will also be learned. 


===1.62: detailed changelog===

 [New items]
All of these can be harvested from unknown seeds. They also have a low chance of getting randomly generated. If harvested, they will gain a +enchant value from Gardening skill or from the fertilizer bonus.

* tea leaf
** Will be used in item fusion to craft black tea or green tea in the future.
* coffee beans
** When used in item fusion, yields 4 x cups of coffees that are all guaranteed to be blessed and inherit the +enchant value of the coffee beans. The +enchant value increases its sell value. You can use this to roleplay coffeshop.
* rice
** When used in item fusion, yields 10 x rice balls that are unblessed but inherit the +enchant value of the rice. It's an early game food that will not train attributes, but the +enchant value will recover SP.
* bannou mugi
** (NB: multi-purpose wheat)
** When used in item fusion, yields 2 x bottles of beer and 2 x bottles of whiskey, all of which a guaranteed to be blessed, as well as 2 x sacks of flour and 2 x raw noodles that are unblessed but inherit the +enchant value of the bannou mugi.

 [New special actions]
* Shield Parry
** Learned upon level up if Shield skill is 35 or above and shield bash feat has been acquired.
** Applies a buff of the same name to all allies in sight who have a shield equipped in a hand when used.
** Will give a (DV total of shields equipped in hands + 5, does not include tonfas/claws)% chance of evading physical attacks. Is calculated separately from the normal evasion. This % chance has a minimum of 0, and maximum of 15. (This means that the lighter shields are better than heavy shields in this respect, and there will be no need to use multiple shields as 1 will suffice.)
** If a melee attack is evaded with the above calculation or with a regular evade/greater evasion while the buff is active, 2 turns of Invert status ailment (NB: "stagger") will be applied to the attacker.
** (Remote attacking opponents will be Inverted, but ranged attackers will not and will only be evaded.)
** Physical damage on characters affected by Invert will be multiplied by 1.75 times.
** High DV shield-wielding characters can now be damage support.

* Golden Storm
** Learned upon level up if Investing skill is 50 or above. (Is a 'W'ide special action.)
** An attack that tosses 200gp at each enemy in sight. Tosses up to 10 times. Gold pieces cannot be retrieved.
** Gold amount cannot be adjusted because that would make balancing this special action difficult. Too bad, really.
** Damage depends on Investing and Throwing skill levels. This really is a spike damage special action for Throwing characters.
** Damage is reduced by target's PV, equipment skill, and Dexterity. Won't work well against opponents that have a lot of defence.
** Yacatect will use this for both of her forms when her health is down to 50% or less, with the probability of her using it depending on the amount of gold [that she has].
** More literal bang for your bucks.

* Rocket Fire
** Same effect as the panzerfaust X item, except damage is reduced by the target's PV, DV, Constitution, and armour skill. If gauge is insufficient, it turns into a regular ranged attack.

* Nuclear Fire
** Same effect as the atomic launcher item, except damage is reduced by the target's PV, DV, Constitution, and armour skill. If gauge is insufficient, it turns into a regular ranged attack.

 [New gauge attack]
* GHAND
** (NB: expends 100% gauge.)
** Power depends on the average value of Will and Magic. Has no effect other than damage, but damage is easy to scale up. 
** Hand-type special action -> (Resolution Hand if you have it; NB: it actually says Palm of Derangement?) -> GHAND would be how attacks are usually chained, but if the Blue Spirit is equipped, only GHAND will be used after selecting the hand-type special action. This increases damage dealt and also allows you to attack distant enemies.

 [Seasoning for prepping food]
* Any of the seasoning items will increase corpse quality by +1. It uses the same variable as the counter for rubbing livestock on the ranch, so the number of seasoning items used on them is the number of times you won't have to rub them. There might not be a point in doing that though.
* All of them will deal a large amount of damage to snail race characters.


===1.61: detailed changelog===

 [Additional main quest content]
* Mid-boss battle in F30 of the Cradle of Chaos, but you can ignore it and go down the stairs if it's too much trouble. Future events will change a lot depending on whether you killed all four unitdead NPCs on the floor.
* Cutscene on F31. Halion and Miros will get placed in Ruoza after that. Miros will disappear from Kurualm.
* Arma on F32.
* Cutscene on F33. F34 is inaccessible for now.

 [New items]
* b-jerky
** Part two of eating legendary monsters is the jerky of the Byakhee!
** Dropped occasionally by the king in yellow. Gives speed experience when eaten. Will not cause insanity.
** What's great about this is that unlike raw shoes, you can feed them to your pets.
** Part three will be roast Shantaks.
* hanabi
** A purely aesthetic item that is rarely randomly generated. One is guaranteed to be at the Ludus summer festival.
** Colour of the effect and where it occurs is random. Can be used on the world map or indoors (consider remodeling your home before that).
** This is for the people who had work or are forever alone and couldn't go to a fireworks display - enjoy the fireworks in Irva with your pets, at least?
** Let me know if you find a better sound effect for it.
* Necromantis
** Unique scythe artifact. Using it causes undead to fuse. Music tickets can be exchanged for it in Act II.

 [Undead fusion]
* Use the Necromantis, select the type of fusion desired, expend 25% gauge, and the undead gets summoned.
* Undead that were subject to fusion will become coffins with 1 hour cooldown.
* The various Necro Force powers will have an effect, but the [fused undead] cannot be put into a coffin.
* Fused undead cannot leave the map they are created in, so it's a good idea to use them only when fighting a strong enemy.
* Undeadgod race NPCs have high attributes and have no weakness to fire so they should prove useful. Remember that they don't have the usual resistance bonuses that undead have though.

 [New NPCs]
* <Halion> the extremist
** Level 20 elea. Has temper bit flag. Potion throwing 1, Nether Arrow, Rampage. On low health, Heal Critical.

The following characters do not spawn naturally. They are either created by the Necromantis, or spawn in an Act III mid-boss battle. Keep that in mind if you're looking to raise them as pets. In the future, they will appear in the Void after clearing Act III.

* unitdead-king
** Undeadgod. Unaffected by equipment attribute that deals massive damage to gods. Rotten corpse. Super Regene on low health. Uses Shadow Step, Squeeze, Boost.
* unitdead-queen
** Undeadgod. Unaffected by equipment attribute that deals massive damage to gods. Rotten corpse. Super Regene on low health. Psychic Wave, Gravity Sphere.
* unitdead-jack
** Undeadgod. Unaffected by equipment attribute that deals massive damage to gods. MP Breath on low health. Nether Breath, Voracity Fang, Draw Shadow, Swarm, Megid Flame.
* unitdead-joker
** Undeadgod. Unaffected by equipment attribute that deals massive damage to gods. Rotten corpse. Cure of Jua on low health. Provoke, Short Teleport, Alchemical Rain, Ice Bolt, Lightning Bolt, Slow. Over-Ray when gauge is sufficient. (When NPCs use Alchemical Rain, it will only make targets wet, but they will remain wet for longer.)

 [New special actions]
* Abyss in the eye
** Gained during level up if the Magic Eye feat has been acquired and Magic is 60 or above.
** Gives the user and all pets in sight with a buff of the same name.
** Gauge absorption is fixed at 2%, and HP, MP absorption will depend on the user's Magic.
* Cowering Smile
** Gained during level up if Gentle Face feat has been acquired and Will is 80 or above.
** All characters excluding the user in sight will get afflicted by 3 turns of Atrophy and Chills. (Which works out to 0.45 times damage dealt for the afflicted characters.)
** Has no effect on characters already affected by Atrophy or Chills.
* Smile Field
** Gained during level up if Gentle Face feat has been acquired and Will is 40 or above.
** Uses Space Retention on the user, and all targets in sight will get buffed with Concentration.
** Strength of buffs will depend on the number of targets and the user's Will.
** If there are no enemies around that use physical attacks then it may be worth using it even if enemies are in sight.
** It makes enemies proc criticals more often so it works well in combination with Emergency Evasion.


===1.60: detailed changelog===

 [More physical intimacy]
* If a pet is at Friend status or above, the player has Action points remaining, and Happiness is not at max, then the [evochat] option will appear in the conversation window.
** When that option is selected, the ambient SFXes like the chattering in town will temporarily be turned off.
** Picking 'Be kind': +1. Chance of an additional +1 depends on impress.
** Picking 'To embarrass': no change. But if they tend to be passive/obedient due to use of the tamer's whip, then there is a chance of gaining +2, [with the chance dependent on the servant/master relationship].
** Give 100,000gp: +1. Roll for random number up to the target's current gold amount - if result is below 100,000, give an additional +1.
** Every action taken other than ending it will reduce Action points by 1. And to be honest, it's going to be very boring if the pet does not have their atmosphere (full body portraits) set. Evochat is short for evoled chat.

 [New NPCs]
* heroyeek
** Level 155 yeek. Uses Draw Shadow, Hero, Slow.
* lunatyeek
** Level 131 yeek. Eye of Insanity, Insult, Mind Bolt.

 [New items] - Purely for roleplaying smoking characters
* In the future, they may be targetable in the 4 cardinal directions to cause a gauge increase or come with withdrawal symptoms.

* suigara - [NB: cigarette butt] Generated at your feet after using a cigarette.
* kiseru - Generated randomly.
* tobacco pipe - Generated randomly.
* hamaki - [NB: cigar] Generated randomly.
* cigarette - Generated randomly.
* tobacco - Generated randomly. Also harvestable from unknown seed crops.

 [New item fusion recipes]
* tobacco processing - crafts cigarette, hamaki, tobacco pipe, and kiseru.

 [New 'W'ide' special action]
* Resolution Hand
** Gained during level up if Touch of Poison or Touch of Sleep feat has been acquired and Alchemy skill is 20 or above.
** When used, it gives a buff to all allies (including the user) in sight that has the same name.
** [With the buff,] Touch of Weakness, Touch of Hunger, Touch of Poison, Touch of Nerve, Touch of Fear, and Touch of Sleep will now deal damage to the target, with amount of damage depending on Alchemy skill and Magic attribute. Damage is reduced by the target's Constitution.
** If the target's health is determined to be less than 1/8 of maximum (this does not include the farmer's bonus), then it will invoke something similar to decapitation and deal lethal damage and give the user a small amount of a random material. Targets on a sandbag do not yield materials.

 [New spell page on the character sheet]
* The spells are basically the same as skills. However, they don't recover much potential when bonus points are spent on them because potential will recover if you do nothing anyway. It's also because not much potential is recovered at high potential. You would probably want to use this to bring spell levels to the point where they are just about to level up before attending magic practice.

 [New AP feat for pets]
* Change attack to arrow magic
** For when you want to make pets with melee/ranged AI attack with only spells instead. (And also if you like dart-type spells.)


===1.59: detailed changelog===

 [Additional main quest content]
* Placed Neres (listed below) and <Melget> the informer on F27 of the Cradle of Chaos. They do not revive when killed.
** Cutscene on F28. Larnneire, Lomias, and Rianna get placed in Ulm-Leson after the event.
** Placed Shuraida and mercenary NPCs on F29. They do not revive when killed.
** F30 is inaccessible for now.

 [New NPCs]
* <Ryutye> the amnesiac
** Level 2 mazin. Will rarely use Space retention.
* <Neres> the amnesiac
** Level 169 imp. Temper bit flag. Shadow Step, Insult, Clash Rush, and only when in melee range, Smash Ground. Spawns equipped with the Zugaikurai listed below.
* <Rianna> the daydreamer
** Level 18 norland. Her class displayed is Handyman, but she's actually a thief. Has an extremely low chance of using Browbeat. Has a low chance of using Tag Force if gauge is 50% or above whether she's in a tag team or not.
* hellstling
** Level 150 quickling. Not suitable for riding. Nether resistance. Class displayed is assassin, but is really a thief. Mist of Darkness. Blade Strings when in melee range.
* stormbling
** Level 106 quickling. Not suitable for riding.  Chaos resistance. Eye of Mana, Nether Breath. Uses Blade Turbulence if the target is not bleeding.
* grass killer
** Level 81 quickling. Not suitable for riding and has cImmune bit flag. Corpse has no effect. Prioritizes movement. Shining Wave. Occasionally uses Suicide Attack.
* grass dancer
** Level 49 quickling. Not suitable for riding and has cImmune bit flag. Corpse has no effect. Moves randomly. Eye of Illusion. Occasionally uses Fascination Dance.

 [New item]
* <Zugaikurai>
** Precious artifact hammer. Randomly generated in high-level areas.

 [New special action]
* Extermination Breath
** Is basically Variable Breath, but does additional fixed damage depending on Control Magic skill, and affects a much, much larger area. It's still a breath attack though, so Charge Attack and equipment attributes that enhance breath attacks will affect it. Learned by the player during level up if the fire-breathing feat has been acquired, Constitution is 80 or above, and Control Magic is 40 or above.

 [Magic practice]
* Sorcier practice [Attack spells] (NB: sic) - gives experience to dart- and bolt-type attack spells.
* Warlock practice [Advanced attack spells] - gives experience to ball-type attack spells and to Meteor.
* Enchanter practice [Buff spells] - gives experience to buff and debuff spells.
* Healer practice [Healing spells] - gives experience to healing, resurrection, and uncurse spells.
* Shaman practice [Special spells] - gives experience to spells related to nature and to the divine, like summoning spells, spells with tile-lingering effects, Oracle, and Domination.
* Mage practice [Detection spells] - gives experience to spells related to movement and knowledge of the surroundings, such as teleport and revealing spells.
** NB: The descriptions in the [brackets] are present in the Japanese language version, but not in English.
** I've tried to have an equal number of spells in each category and to make each category make sense. Course titles are more or less flavour text for role-playing purposes. Cost depends on the level of the spells in that category with a lower limit of 5 and upper limit of 15. 
** This is to make it easier to become a spell-caster in early game, as well as to alleviate the problem where spell levels don't increase unless the player spams them.
** The amount of spell experience given is fixed, so it's best to attend the practice with high potential in as many spells in that category as you can.
** There is no chance of bonus experience from Learning attribute. Of course, if you don't know the spell, then it won't have any effect.
** I considered a system where spells are leveled using an item that is randomly generated in dungeons, but that meant that physical-attack classes would master spells at the same rate as mages. That lead to the creation of this system, where spells basically compete with combat skills in resources. The cost of practices and the amount of experience given is subject to balancing.

 [New pregnancies]
* sunbararian -> sunbararian
* giant eater flower -> man eater flower
* heqet -> musical notadpole
* camouflaged imp -> camouflaged imp


===1.58: detailed changelog===

 [Additional main quest content]
* Mid-boss battle on F25 of Cradle of Chaos. There will be a lot of regular monsters (with the Cradle's level boost). On top of that, if the <Lankata> listed below is alive, enemies map-wide will occasionally be buffed by Cheer and those with gauge below 50% will gain 10% gauge. This should make it pretty difficult, but you don't really have to defeat the enemies. The staircase is unlocked, so you can just make a beeline for F26 without killing anything. If you defeat <Lankata> here, he will be marked as defeated, and that will change the events that occur in the future. (That said, it won't affect what items you'll get or anything like that.) When defeated, the zanan enhanced soldier and lothrian agent listed below will be placed in Amur-Cage. There will be a cutscene on F26. F27 is inaccessible for now.

 [New NPCs]
* zanan enhanced soldier
** Level 152 zanan. Squeeze. Draw Shadow. On low health, Super Regene.
** Is not randomly generated.
* zanan old soldier
** Level 113 zanan. Shadow Step. When MP is sufficient and target's gauge is above 50%, uses Pressure.
* killer nurse
** Level 61 zanan.
* <Lankata> the lightning of blue
** Level 168 elea. Mist of Dazzling, melee wait, and rarely Fire a volley. Healing Rain on low health.
* lothrian agent
** Level 122 elea. Slow. On low health, Cure of Jua.
** Is not randomly generated.
* dark elea
** Level 78 elea. Gravity Sphere, Mist of Darkness, Nightmare, Darkness Bolt, Chaos Eye. On low health, Heal Critical.

 [New items]
* soup of wonderland
** When eaten, height becomes the average of current height and 150 cm, and weight becomes the average of current weight and 40kg.
** Blessed, cursed soup has the same effects. This item is for people would like to return their bodies to a somewhat more human form.
** Dropped by little girl upon death. Is also rarely randomly generated.

* <Dokuro-Mikaduki>
** Artifact skull bow. Randomly generated.

* <Heltiarre>
** Artifact short bow. Equipped by the aforementioned Lankata.

 [New equipment attribute]
* It enchances your throwing rock.
** Staves may come with this attribute. Equipping multiple of these will have no additional effect.
** Each of the distance multipliers gets +05 to it, and when attacking, the pierce will increase to 70%.
** When an attack affected by this attribute lands, it will have a dull sound effect.
** Stones were weak, had no additional effects, and you had to go through a lot of trouble just to change their material, so this is a buff just for it.
** The drawback is that the attribute appears only on melee weapons. This does not affect the power of rocks thrown at a poor performer.
** As for why staves, one explanation is that you can use the long staff as a bat, the whip as a slingshot, or the staff as a slingstaff/lacrosse stick to fling rocks at enemies.
** It should be fairly reasonable, because in real-life history, slings were a rather formidable weapon capable of inflicting lethal injuries against armored opponents, and had a longer effective distance than bows. It is not a joke weapon.
** Feel free to use it to roleplay a shepherd, or change the sprite and roleplay some ball sport.


===1.57: detailed changelog===

 [Shop types]
* the goods shop. Default. Works the same as previous versions.
* the food shop. Will sell only food items. Final selling price has x 2 modifier.

* the blacksmith. Will sell only equipment. Final selling price has x 2 modifier.
* the inn shop. Will sell only containers and potions. Final selling price has x 3 modifier.

The default shop has a 1/8 chance of cancelling the sale of an item. The food shop and the rest of the new shop types, however, do not have this chance of cancelling. Number of items sold remains random.


===1.56: detailed changelog===

 [Changes to feats and new special actions]
* Strings Assassin
** Replaces detection-type feats.
** Grants the special action Blade Strings.
** Target the skill in one of the four directions.
** If target is not self, deals damage dependent on Tactics and Dexterity.
** Usage gives Tactics experience. Damage is reduced by target's PV and Constitution.
** If target's HP is less than 1/9 of max, then invoke Decapitation.
** If target is under the effect of Bind, then deal bleed damage depending on Tactics skill.
** If target is self, then a wire trap is set at that position.
** Placing and removing wire traps will not give any experience to Disarm Trap.
** Wire traps will deal damage depending on the floor you are on and on the target's Speed.
** That damage is reduced by PV, and floating characters will not set them off.
** Traps disappear after being set off once.
** This may not be the trap battle system I said I was going to make.

* Dancing Wire special action.
** If you have the above Strings feat and 40 or more Tactics, you will learn this at your next level up.
** Causes 3 turns of Bind and Draw Shadow.

* Magic Eye
** New feat. Grants Eye of Mana.

* Eye of Illusion special action
** If you have the Magic Eye feat above and 20 or more Control Magic, you will learn this at your next level up.
** Deals mind damage depending on Magic and Will stats.

* Eye of Stiffen special action
** Deals nerve damage depending on Magic and Will stats, and will also increase the target's defence.
** The increase in defence lasts for 3 turns.
** Reduction of defence by Pulverization, melee weapon and the equipment attributes on them, and panzerfaust X will overwrite this increase in defence. (Overwrite, not negate!)
** This special action has its drawbacks, but it deals enough damage and the status effects have enough power to make up for it.

 [Changes to AI]
* medusa will now use Magic Dart, Eye of Stiffen, melee wait, and maintain a distance of 2.
* euryale will now use Eye of Illusion.
* stheno will now use Eye of dimness.
* cockatrice will now use Eye of Stiffen instead of Touch of Nerve. Maintains distance of 3.

 [New gauge attack]
* Mind Break
** Deals nerve and mind damage dependent on enchant level of equipment and Magic and Will stats.
** Also deals MP damage.
** Also increases target's sanity by the same amount as Eye of Insanity.
** Also causes the same amount of Dim as Eye of dimness.
** Also causes the target to vomit.
** Unique NPCs and characters immune to dim will be unaffected by dim and insanity.

 [Randomness of additional melee/ranged attacks]
* Before this version, extra attacks proced when strength of the equipment attribute > a random number between 0-99 + modifier.
* In this version, extra attacks will now proc if 2 * equipment attribute strength + 1 > a random number between 0-99 + modifier.
* The probability that an extra attack will proc increases with the equipment attribute strength and approaches 100%, but it will never be 100%.
* The equipment attribute is also multiplied by 2 in the calculation now, so you will see more extra attacks even with low level equipment attributes.
* By the way, warrior and gunner classes have +5 to the chance of doing the first extra attack.

 [Changes affecting only the English version - an *unofficial* list]
* Silent Ocean flavour text changed from "You're all alone." to "An expanse of ocean and fog spreads out."
* <Siraha> the black cloth renamed as <Kuron> the black cloth, <Kuron> the white cloth renamed as <Siraha> the white cloth.
* Changes made to sex and forbidden meat?
* Changes to the message displayed when rod/scroll of uncursed is used.
* Yith Rank enemy encounters are now named as such instead of being a duplicate Dragon Rank.
* The second Apocalypse ancient book has been renamed as True Apocalypse.
* Changes to juice, milk, and coffee item naming convention and grammar?
* "You have no gag reflex." in the profile has been changed to "Your jokes are terrible.".


===1.55: detailed changelog===

[New Act III sub quest]
* Clear it just by talking to the NPC from 14:30 - 14:59 on the indicated day.
* Only the darkness staff will be awarded when clearing the quest for the first time.
* From the second time onwards, the quest reward changes depending on the time you talk to her:
** 14:30 - 14:39 to receive the jewel tear of god for darkness bolt invoke
** 14:40 - 14:49 to receive the jewel tear of god for elemental scar invoke 
** 14:50 - 14:59 to receive the jewel tear of god that increases spell power
* She tell you to come back "in a moment" but will actually ask you to come in a month, because a month's time is but a moment for a god who has lived for about a million years.

[Changes to how Urcaguary's reward is given]
* The reward now changes depending on the time the quest is completed.
** 0:00 - 5:59 to receive the jewel tear of god for Gravity Sphere invoke
** 6:00 - 11:59 to receive the jewel tear of god that deals magic damage
** 12:00 - 17:59 to receive the jewel tear of god for absolute piercing attack
** 18:00 - 23:59 to receive the jewel tear of god for the remote blow enchant

[New artifact]
* Elements Eyes	
** Choose an element from a list and applies it to all allies within sight.
** That element will then be treated as if it had the highest resist value. There will be no change in the actual resistance.
** The number of ways it can be used are limited, but depending on the situation, it could be quite powerful if you change elements and inflict their respective status effects.
** The effect wears off from everyone after sleep (it is unaffected by the sleep status effect).
** While it is in effect, it won't return to your attribute's element.
** (After waking up, using the attributes again will return it to your original element.)
** NB: Typo here? "Using the Elements Eyes again"?
** It's coloured to look like one of the items that you can use to transform yourself like in the TV shows.
** The original design was kind of gross, and was pretty disgusting when you looked at it a little more closely.
** I might add more skills that are affected by this later on.

[New characters]
* sea fallen angel	
** level 158 seamonster. Float, invisible.
** Gravity Sphere, Power Breath, Psychic Wave, Eye of Insanity.
* nine dart garfish	
** level 139 seamonster. Float, Clash Rush.
* orcinus orca	
** level 128 seamonster. Float. Player-homing AI.
** Shadow Step, Voracity Fang, Nether Breath
* manta rayarn	
** level 100 seamonster. Float, neutral.
** Web, Lightning Bolt.
* flower coral	
** level 90 seamonster. Neutral. Does not move even in combat.
** Random colour. Silent Ocean, Draw Shadow, Melee idle
** NB: Melee idle is move ID -3. Does melee attack if target is range=1, else nothing. I don't know the english name for this. This seems to be a feature from vanilla elona.
* abysstar
** level 70 seamonster. Water Bolt, Provoke.
* flight fish
** level 40 seamonster. Float. Shadow Step, Suspicious Hand, Scavenge.
* gunfish	
** level 15 seamonster. Float. Short Teleport.

[New evolution pattern]
* Gunfish evolves to zap gunfish with machine heart, learns Fire a volley.

[Adjustment to NPC adventurers' starting level, fame, and hiring fee]
* Limited starting level to 250. Made the increase in hiring fee less steep, and made it cap at 99999 gp.
* Made it easier to meet them and reduced the number of times you have to hire them to make it more practical to make them your ally.

[Expansion of werewolf voting system]
* The number of votes is slightly random, but more votes will go to NPCs that you have determined to be a werewolf via conversation or that are currently hostile.
* If there are no NPCs that are alive and have at least 1 vote, the execution will not take place.
* Executions will do 44444 damage, so it is possible for an NPC to survive it.
* This is different from the executions that were in game in that your fame will not rise, but items will drop.
* If there are no werewolf attacks, then voting will not occur.
* So if you are after NPC drops, then you may want play such that no harm comes to the werewolves.
* When it is time to vote, you can buy the revival of right to vote with authority points.
** This is under the "Policy implementation" option in town management.

[Feat changes and new special abilities]
* Uncontrollable power
** Replaces the arm-wresting feats. Gives the special action Uncontroll.
** I probably don't need to explain this, but how this works is that if you don't already have the buff when using Uncontroll, you will gain the buff and a status effect.
** If you already have the buff, it will use either Shadow Step and Swarm depending on your distance to the enemy.
** It uses more sp than those actions by themselves, but Fury+Swarm would be ridiculous in early-game.

* Jiu-jitsu
** Replaces the martial arts feats. Gives the special action Vindalian Jiu-jitsu.
** When used, Vindalian Jiu-jitsu switches you between Jiu-jitsu and normal mode.
** In Jiu-jitsu mode, the text for martial arts usage will be changed to throws, and the enemy's defence will use depend on their DV and Light Armor skill.
** The effect of Squeeze will change. Damage will depend on Dexterity and the Martial Arts skill, and will also Bind the enemy for 1 extra turn, but the user will also be under the effect of Bind for 1 turn.
** There's more to martial arts roleplaying than physical blows.
** Characters that will now use Vindalian Jiu-jitsu:
*** <Mary> the insect master
*** ultimate golem
*** <Arma> the tour guide
** The above NPCs have a chance to switch to Jiu-jitsu mode if the enemy's PV is higher than the DV by 100.
** If the enemy's DV>PV by 100, then there is a chance that these NPCs will disable Jiu-jitsu mode.

* Sexy Dance
** Replaces the sexy feats. Gives (W)ide special action Fascination Dance.
** Fascination Dance causes 4 turns to pass, after which the user's Charisma will be rolled against the Will of each enemy in sight.
** It will not work against blinded, sleeping, and unconscious characters, undead summoned via necromancy, and bored characters.
** If the roll succeeds, it inflicts 1 turn of paralysis.
** This is the AOE and vulnerable version of Bewitch that also prevents the enemy's gauge from increasing.
** If used during Party Time!, it will take 2/3 of the number of turns performing takes, and award you with more points than performing, but you will receive less money and no items.
** Characters that will now use Fascination Dance:
*** butterspy
*** soul bee (evolved wasp)
*** pixie
*** <Karavika>
*** necro dancer
*** NB: soul bee may not be the actual name


===1.54: detailed changelog===

[New magic]
* Water Bolt
** Bolt spell without an element. Has a spellbook. Damage + wet status. Clears map effects within its area of effect.
** <Abyss Princess> now uses this spell instead of Crystal Spear.
* Bubble Storm
** Ball spell without an element. Has a corresponding stave (which cannot be crafted). Damage + wet status. Clears map effects within its area of effect.
** basatan now uses this spell instead of Ice Ball.

[New (W)ide special actions]
* Silent Ocean
** Converts a large area of tiles (up to but not including ID 350) into water panels. Clears map effects within its area of effect.
** Characters within its area of effect will also be inflicted with Mist of Silence with a set spell power. Characters not floating or under the effects of Gravity will be inflicted with Wet status.

* Dimensional Fishing
** Prerequisite: Level up with 30 or more Fishing skill.
** Draw a hostile enemy on the map to you, and gives Fishing exp.
** Requires neither fishing rod nor bait. It will work even if you are surrounded by walls.
** The order in which NPCs will be drawn towards you is set, and will not change even if you load a save.
** As long as the NPC who has been drawn to you with Dimensional Fishing is still alive, the next NPC may not be drawn.
** This is basically Draw Shadow that ignores your range of sight, so it will fail if the target cannot teleport.
** Useful for killing the targets one at a time, or when you can't find the enemy during a hunting quest.

[New items]
* atomic launcher
** Aim it at the cell you want to fire it into and use it. Its power depends on Marksman, Carpentry, and Disarm Trap skill levels.
** It ignores defence, but if the three skills above are at low level, it won't be any better than a nuke.
** This will be considered an attack, so it will cause karma loss and Barrier feat activation.
** It is not affected by Magic Control, but shooting it at the very limit of its range (which is out of sight) will prevent the user from taking damage.
** It will not cause the karma loss that is intrinsic to nuke usage, and will not count towards completion of Noel's quest, but it will count towards the nuke counter in the journal.
** Unlike the Cat's Cradle (the regular nuke), it will also destroy all wall tiles within its area of effect. Good for when you need breathing space.
** Is not generated randomly. The only way to obtain it is through item fusion.

* M202 special
** Aim it at the cell you want to fire it into and use it. Its power depends on Marksman, Endurance, and fire resistance.
** It sets a larger area on fire than the Fire Wall spell, and the fires will last longer.
** The user will not be damaged by it. After the damage calculation, the target is afflicted by a short duration of Element Scar.
** You can put it to good use when hunting undead or as a debuffing tool... or you could go nuts with it and burn everything down. Like Fire Wall, it will not be affected by magatama.
** Generated rarely.

* panzerfaust X
** If no target is selected, it will select one automatically and fire.
** Single-target damage that depends on Marksman and Perception.
** The target's PV will be lowered for 3 of the target's turns, and recover by 100 per turn.
** It ignores cMetal and cArmour bit flags.
** Generated rarely.

* <Sasanqua Sickle>
** Precious chain sickle.
** The Kunoichi below will carry it.
** Trades damage for invokes and accuracy.

* gasoline
** When drunk by or dowsed on a character, causes confusion (of lower strength than a potion of confusion) and a long-lasting duration of Oil status. Works with Alchemical Rain. Randomly generated.

* essential oil
** When drunk by or dowsed on a character, causes confusion (of even lower strength than gasoline) and a short-lasting duration of Oil status. Works with Alchemical Rain. Rarely randomly generated.
** Might be used in aroma therapy in the future.

[Changes to the repertoire of potions for the three ThrowPotion special actions]
* actThrowPotionMinor: blind, confusion, paralysis, sleep, beer
* actThrowPotionMajor: silence, slow, gasoline, weaken resistance, whiskey
* actThrowPotionGreater: sulfuric, aqua sanctio, disaster, crim ale

[New character]
* <Fashionable Kunoichi>
** Level 165 Norland. Hmm, a fashionable kunoichi... who could this be?
** Is a warmage, but will display as a ninja. Thunder vortex, Speed, and Distant Attack 7.
** NB: This will say Distant Attack in-game, but it's a misnomer.

[Changes to existing unique NPCs]
* <Getuei> the ninja master
** No longer use decapitation. Will use Shadow Step, Blade Turbulence, and Struck Out instead.

[Additions to the main quest]
* F17 Cradle of Chaos event.
* If sub quest: Rule of Ninja has been completed, the <Fashionable Kunoichi> above and <Getuei> (neutral, has starting level of 140, and is visible) will be placed on F18 of the Cradle. They will both revive in a day on this floor. If the quest has not been completed, F18 will be empty.
* F19 event. The player will not be able to enter F20 yet.


===1.53: detailed changelog===

 [New evolution]
* imp, nether imp, chaos imp evolve with the king heart into great imp, and learn Magic Equip. Speed increase depends on the original pet. Shines.

 [New special ability]
* Bound in Blood
** Allies that are of the same race as the user will experience the effects listed below. The user will bleed severely.
** Gives Speed, Hero, and Attribution Shield depending on the Will of the target. Has less of an effect on the player.
** If gauge is less than 50%, then increase it by at most 30% depending on the target's gauge.

* MP Breath
** Use 25% gauge and 50% of current MP. Will not activate if MP is less than 50% of maximum MP.
** The effect will be coloured with the colour of the element that the user has the highest resistance against, but the breath itself is of magic element.
** It has the same power as Power Breath, but adds the value of the expended MP to the damage.
** It is unaffected by the enchant that enhances breath attacks or by Charge Attack.
** It destroys walls and floor tiles in its area of effect. (The attack will pierce walls.)
** Player learns this upon level up if the Fire Breath feat has been learned and unbuffed Constitution and Magic are 60 or greater.

* Made the dialogue complement the story thus far, and added foreshadowing.
* Placed <Saimef> the doggod on F16. Talk to him to receive an artifact, and <Saimef> will bleed. Defeating him will give you nothing, and he will resurrect on that floor in a day.

===1.51: detailed changelog===

* Made the tester appear in Amur-Cage after talking to <Regulus>/<Renai> at the border.
* An additional tester will be placed there after the event finishes, even if there is already one on the map.

* You will be able to take <Belphat> along with you after talking to him. (Works just like <Poppy>)

** When on, zapping attack rods will not reduce their number of charges.

* Lock Break
** Learned during level up when Lock Picking is 60 or more.
** Works on chests, gamble chests, and safes.
** Use half of the sum of the Strength and Lockpicking of all allies (including the player) within sight to attempt to open the chest. skeleton key does not increase chance of success.
** When the lock is successfully opened, there will be one less item in the chest or the safe.

 [New evolution]
* lizard man and lizard mage evolve with king heart to lizard majesty and learn Shadow rush.

 [Changes to statue of Opatos]
* In previous versions, diastrophisms on a continent did not overwrite all random dungeons on it.
* statue of Opatos will now rewrite all dungeons, even the ones that have been entered but have yet to be cleared. 1/4 of the value of the deepest dungeon cleared will be used for generating dungeons, and the regional multiplier will be 2, so dungeon levels should not be in the extremes as much now.

===1.49: detailed changelog===

 [Behaviour of unconscious NPCs]
* They won't catch pickpocket attempts. (They won't hear a loud noise and wake up like when they're sleeping.)

 [Behaviour when gauge is 101 - 200%]

* Unique NPCs who are not pets will not use their gauge when they have more than half of their health. When their health is less than 50%, they will use gauge attacks even if their gauge is below 200%. Allies will not conserve their gauge if they are set to Onslaught mode.
* The eight gods and that snail NPC will not conserve their gauge and will use the special action unique to them.
* Gauge will not decrease when it is 200% or 100%. When it is 101 - 199%, it will decrease by 1% every turn.
* When a gauge attack is activated at 200% gauge, an extra melee attack or an attack from the second weapon will activate another gauge attack in the same turn.
* Failing that, any attack done during time stop will activate that second gauge attack. This makes it easier to defeat enemies that heal. (Enemies can also use this against you.)

 [New NPCs]
* fallen angel
** Level 139 angel. Eye of brainwashing. Insult on low health.
* cupid inspector
** Level 122 angel. God. Rubbing. Healing Rain on low health.

** Generated where you can find deed of homes. An upgrade from a small castle. Like the small castle, comes with shopkeepers.
* first aid kit
** Heals user or an adjacent target. You can heal any NPC, even those who are not allies. Heal amount depends on player's Dexterity and Gene engineer.
** More important than its ability to heal is its ability to shorten negative status effects. If and when applicable, it reduces negative status effects to 1/8 + 1 turns (rounded down).
** It's a healing method for people who don't even want to depend on magic devices.
** Somewhat troublesome to craft in early game, but still possible.
* special ammos box
** Replenishes special ammo of user or an adjacent target. For people who find it too troublesome to carry multiple ammos and always end up using normal ammunition.
** Craftable.

 [New special actions]
* Over Long Throw
** Change range multiplier for Throwing to 02-02-08-08-09-09-10-10 for range 1-8 respectively during that turn, and execute a Throwing attack.
** This can be the trigger for a gauge attack, and the triggered gauge attack will also use the aforementioned range multipliers.
** This may not be used with Struck Out (another Throwing special action) at the same time.
** Learned during level up when Throwing skill is 50 or above.

 [Modification of coffin of necromancy with monster parts]
* Recipe name: necro remodel
* Summoned undead will have +5 levels, and have additional skills and stuff depending on the monster part added.

* card: becomes coffin of necromancy-Shion. Undead takes on the appearance of that NPC but with a light purple tinge.

* You can make the undead specialize as meat shields or as attackers.
* Or you can be a psycho and enjoy letting them wear the skin of that girl you like.
* Or you could also make an undead wear someone's skin and make them attack a particular person...


===1.48: detailed changelog===

* That said, if you want to get a really good score what you need is good reflexes.
* You'll win a prize of 2 pp for a score of 200 or more. (Subject to change.)

 [Damage done by 3rd melee weapon and onwards]
* The 3rd weapon does 60% damage, the 4th does 36%, and so on, getting multiplied 0.6 each time.
* That still means you would be more powerful the more weapons you have, but it should make having other body parts instead of hands a viable option.

 [New sub quest]
* [Insect curse]
** Recommended level changed to 40.
** Deliver three items to <Mary> to clear it.
** Then give potion (listed in journal) to <Alice>.
** Report to <Mary>. If <Alice> is dead, she'll be surprised and the quest will not proceed. Otherwise, you'll receive the reward and the quest is cleared.
** Talk to <Alice>.
** Revisit the sacred library to find <Aribel> there.

* ambystoma evolves with evolution heart to salamander.


===1.47: detailed changelog===

 [Details on the implemented effects]
* Subject to change.
* <Dumbbell of Opatos>
** Effect of training machine is multiplied by 10. (It's affected by probability, so I'm referring to the expected value.) By the time you obtain this, your attributes might be high enough that they don't increase even with this item if your potential is low.
* <Amulet of Jure>
** Probability that player will get sick becomes 1/64.
** Or to be more precise, there is a 63/64 chance that the player recovers from sickness immediately after getting sick.
* <Candle of Luluwy>
** When master/servant value increases, impress also increases.
** Depending on the options you pick and their current impress, forced sleep sharing can have a net increase in impress.
* <Very pistol of Mani>
** Having this in your inventory will allow you to give allies directives during battle even if they are out of sight. Directives will also not consume a turn.
* <Glasses of Yacatect>
** Having this in your inventory will allow you to see decimal values of the main attributes (except luck), their potential, and their bonuses (from equipment and such).
** You will be able to track your attributes as well.
* <Bookmark of Itzpalt>
** Having this in your inventory and reading a skill book will set its cooldown to 1/12. (4 hours) You won't be able to read skill books continuously in normal weather, but even then you'll gain 5 times as much experience in the same time compared to reading the books in bad weather.
** Great for reading skill books every now and then.
* <Mug of Ehekatl>
** When the player drinks from a well (and from toilets and fountains), status effects, pregnancy, monster summoning, changes to attributes, and mutation events will no longer occur. Instead, it'll just say "Phew, fresh water tastes good."
** If you're afraid of getting mutations and attribute loss in end-game, then this is for you.
* <Scissors of Kumiromi>
** It removes the chance that a new seedling will not grow after harvesting crops, independent of your Gardening skill. This means that if your Gardening level is high enough, a new seedling is guarenteed to grow after harvest as long as it's not an artifact seed.

 [New NPCs]
* Sylph
** Level 130 ghost. Uses Voracity Fang, Draw Shadow, etc.
** Not randomly generated. The only time they will appear is during Lulwy's Summon chaos.
** (Lulwy has been made to use Summon chaos.)
** "I've teared the former servant limb from limb to feed the sylphs."
* <13th step ghost>
** Base level 66 ghost.
** Not randomly generated. 1/130 chance of being generated when going upstairs to a floor with a floor number of 66 or greater. This is a repeatable event. They start at 3/4th the level of the floor. Guaranteed to drop an upstairs item.
** On some days they do not have a chance to appear, so you won't bump into them on those days, even if you reload the save file over and over again.
** Uses Psychic Wave, Nether Wave, etc.
** A dastardly monster that attacks adventurers who escape to the floor above after they have been worn down by monsters in the floor below.

 [New (W)ide special actions]
* Psychic Wave
** Bind enemies in sight for 1 turn and deal 1.5 to 2 times the user's level in unmitigatable damage.
** Used by the <13th step ghost> above, and <Nine Head Dragon> the abyss will now use this as well.
* Reading Party
** Learned by player upon level up when unbuffed Learning is 40 or greater.
** Takes average of Literacy and Memorization skill levels of all allies in range and adds it to the player's, then use this value for reading. (Bonus skill level contribution from each pet is capped at 1/5+3 of the player's skill levels).
** Completely negates negative effects of reading failures and stops reading, but number of turns it takes to read is slightly increased.
** When reading is successful, allies gain Literacy experience.
** When reading spellbooks successfully, allies will also gain Memorization experience depending on the difficulty of the spellbook.
** They will gain no experience if the reading fails.
** This is the reading version of Ensemble.


===1.46: detailed changelog===

 [duel glove effects]
* A thrown duel glove will have an effect and begin the duel only if the target is in a state where he can be talked to normally, and is not affected by Sleep, Paralyzed, Blinded, Dim, nor Fear.
* If not, the duel will not begin, and the thrown glove will be on the ground.
* During the duel, the map cannot be exited from the sides nor from stairs,
* nor by moving to another map with a Sub Quest, to the arena, with Return, with Escape, nor to the showroom
* nor can you begin a duel with another NPC.
* Incognito/disguise will also have no effect.
* (Please report loopholes if you find any.)
* The duel ends when the player or the opponent is dead.
* It also ends when you are Forced drafted by a guard, forced out of the Island in madness in Act III, when the job quest timer runs out, or forcibly removed from the map via any other means.
* If the duel opponent is a god, remanding them will also end the duel.
* Duel opponents will drop 1/4 of their money (except shopkeepers), and their card and figure are guaranteed to drop.
* All miracle-level and above equipment will also drop. (Except for precious items that have been set to not drop.)
* This allows you to strip adventurers of all their belongings. That is, if you can win against them.

 [Increase in number of items for sale depending on trade goods sold]
* For every 3000 gp of items sold, the number of items generated for sale will increase by 1.
* The items for sale are not pre-determined, and is determined only when you talk to the trader, and the number wil also accumulate.
* Depending on how much is invested, you can temporarily exceed the cap in number of items for sale.
* For your sanity, please don't aim for the 20-item limit. This is just so that the trader will have a few more items to offer for sale for your convenience.
* Traders don't have that much money in the beginning anyway.
* Of course, you can still calculate the optimal trade good to put in your cart given its carrying capacity, or you can mix in the goods that you crafted yourself, or use this to manage the amount of money you carry around.

 [Handmade gift event when waking up from sleep]
* Conditions for crafting items are listed below.
* Tailoring skill-dependent
** gloves
** tight boots - cannot be crafted below skill level 10
** coat - cannot be crafted below skill level 20

** charm - cannot be crafted below skill level 40
** cloak - cannot be crafted below skill level 50

** tower shield - cannot be crafted below skill level 60
** composite helm - cannot be crafted below skill level 70
** plate gauntlets - cannot be crafted below skill level 80
** plate mail - cannot be crafted below skill level 90

* Items made are all miracle-quality, with a player's luck + impress x 2 chance of being godly-quality.
* Items made are also blessed. By the power of love!
* When you first get a pet to Soul Mate status, you probably haven't been able to gear any of them up properly yet. And shortly after that it should be raining miracle-quality equipment, so this should be fairly balanced.
* By the way, what the pet will say will change if their Dexterity is 100 or above.

 [New evolutions]
* rabbit evolves with magic heart to red-eyes w.rabbit, learns Time Stop.
* Only female rabbits are able to evolve with another heart to sylbunny and learn Cheer.
* These two evolutions are mutually exclusive - you won't be able to get both on the same rabbit.

** When attacking with 20 or more MP, 0.5% of current MP is added to the weapon dice roll (With a limit of 200).
** Current MP will then decrease by 5%.
** That means that if your MP is 40k or more, you will expend 2000 MP to attack, theoretically making this the strongest weapon.
** How useful this w ill be depends on you.
* kneaded sweets of witch
** Target is fully healed, but is rendered Unconscious. Is a potion and can be used with Alchemical Rain.
** You can use this on strong enemies to buy time to for Charge Attack or to run away, or use this in conjunction with Vernis Original to heal your pets in a pinch.
** Or you could also get really turned on by unconscious NPCs covered in a sticky fluid.
* The items below have not had their effects implemented yet:

===1.45: detailed changelog===

 [Special Lomias scene during tutorial]
* Something happens if Larnneire is dead when you talk to Lomias and tell him to get out of your house.
* This scene does not benefit you in any way, and you have to go through a lot of trouble just to be able to see it, but it's something that was already in vanilla Elona. All I did was make it work properly.
* What was supposed to happen in vanilla Elona was that they would leave the house without dead Larnneire taking part in the conversation.

 [Details on additions to main quest]
* Mid-boss battle after F10 event in Cradle of Chaos.
* Map effect lasts until the boss is defeated.
* Map effect affects all characters including the boss, and inflicts 50 turns of Bind and Space retention around boss.
* But if there are no Melugast typeM alive, then 94% of the time Bind will last 5 turns instead.
* Talk to <Gavela> after defeating it to receive a reward, and that will be the end of the additional content added.
* The furthest you can go is F11. (Time-dependent BGM in F11 and onwards will be different that the one in regular dungeons.)

 [Power of "absorbs MP" equipment attribute]
* Calculated with strength of enchant and damage before deduction, then subtracted by target's PV.
* Characters with higher PV will be better off.
* Mana absorption rate still remains at 20%. So that means that amount of mana the target loses is not the amount absorbed, but mana damage dealt to target is about 5 times mana absorbed.

 [Details on the new NPCs]
* Melugast typeM
** Level 132 behicle. Does not spawn naturally. One of these is placed in Melugas after the boss battle. This NPC can be recruited with an astral light pen.

===1.44: detailed changelog===

 [Expanded main quest]
* Added scene that plays after fulfilling <Erystia>'s request and returning to the border (either of the North or South will do) or to Larna.
* After that, talking to <Gavela> and heading to F8 of Cradle of Chaos will cause another scene to play.
* You won't be able to descend to F10 just yet.

 [New items]
* Juice mixer
** Usable furniture. Neither Cooking skill nor SP is needed for making juice.
** You can offer this to Mani.
* juice
** Worth the same as the item before it was turned into juice.
** Is a type of potion. Does not rot. Cannot be used for Alchemical Rain.
** Satiates hunger, though not as much as milk.
** Gives the same amount of attribute experience as the raw item, and experience gained is unaffected by satiation level.
** Does not matter if the original item was rotten.
** But there will also be no bonus from enchant level of the original item.
** (B)lend juice together to make mix juice.
** You can also make mix juice by putting herbed food into the Juice mixer, but this mix juice has no herb effect. So there's no merit to doing this.
** (B)lending it with milk will give the mix milk item. Mix milk has half the effect on height compared to milk. Blending an entire stack of juice with milk will only produce 1 mix milk at a time.
* milk cofee (sic)
** Made by (B)lending coffee with milk.
** Is still a coffee and will remove all sleepiness. But apart from that, it will also have half the effect on height compared to milk.
** In Japanese, cafe au lait or cafe aulait might be a more common spelling, but I'll just settle for this name to make things consistent.
The items listed below are unobtainable in-game. These items temporarily change your appearance and give different buffs, and are reusable after a cooldown time.
* alpha shift core
** Increases Strength and Perception, gives magic reflect.
* beta shift core
** Increases Dexterity and Magic, gives magic resistance.
* gamma shift core

** This works the same as the Priest class feat. If you have that feat, this bonus is added to it.
* omega shift core
** Increases Strength, Constitution, Perception, Dexterity, Magic, Speed, and magic resistance.
** Decrease HP and MP by 1/150 (lower limit 1) every turn.
** (Even if this brings you down to negative health, you won't die unless you receive damage from something.)
** Gauge does not decrease every turn.

You can re-transform while a transformation in an effect, allowing you to sort of pull off a multi-stage transformation. However, the buff from the previous transformation will be removed. (You cannot have multiple transformation buffs.)

You may want to be careful about looking at the following.

 [Material groups for change material]
* Inferior material
** paper -> cloth -> silk -> mica -> raw -> leather -> glass -> scale -> coral -> bronze -> lead -> bone -> paper (back to beginning)
* Change material
** zylon -> obsidian -> chrome -> metal -> steel -> chain -> silver -> platinum -> gold -> perl -> griffon scale -> (dragon scale if blessed) -> (adamantium if blessed) -> zylon (back to beginning)
* Superior material
** dawn cloth -> spirit cloth -> dragon scale -> crystal -> titanium -> mithril -> adamantium -> emerald -> diamond -> (rubynus if blessed) -> (ether if blessed) -> dawn cloth (back to beginning)

 [Pattern for material changing with material kits]
1. Choose from leather, dawn cloth, scale, glass, mithril, silver, and dragon scale.
2. Choose from silk, zylon, raw, crystal, metal, platinum, and diamond
3. Choose from cloth, bone, emerald, steel, gold, lead, and ether
4. Choose from spirit cloth, coral, mica, obsidian, titanium, and rubynus
5. Choose from paper, gryffon scale, perl, bronze, chain, chrome, and adamandium
* The above 5 lists are cycled from the 1st to the 30th of each month.

 [Rules selecting equipment attribute options for living weapon level up]
* The +enhance value of the weapon, the right side number for the damage dice, and in-game month are added. The resulting sum is then divided by the length of the list below, then uses the remainder to pick the attribute within that list. (Remainder 0 -> remainder 1 -> remainder 2...)
* NB: This is done for each of the 8 lists, resulting in 8 options to pick from.
* This means that if the +enhance value and the damage dice of the weapons remains the same, then the options offered when the weeapon levels up will be the same until the month changes.
* Increasing any of the 3 factors by 1 will pick the next attribute in the list. An exception is December -> January as it doesn't increase the month number by 1, so be careful.
* This system allows the attribute choices offered to change without depending on a rare item, and lets users stack attributes without understanding how the mechanics actually work. Choices offered will also differ between weapons.

* Resistances: list length 11
** Fire -> cold -> lightning -> darkness -> mind -> poison -> nether -> sound -> nerrve -> chaos -> magic ->
