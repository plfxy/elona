When using save data from vanilla Elona 1.16 or prior, you will need to:
* Save while your character is in a town, and
* Unassign the shopkeeper in your shop, the breeder in your ranch, and so on.
Internally, the code for updating game saves works exactly the same as it does in vanilla Elona so there's no need to update older versions to vanilla Elona 1.16 first.
However, before moving the save file over to the newer game version, do make a backup copy of it somewhere else.

When using a save file from Elona plus 1.18 or prior:
* All gift items have their quality changed to "cheap".
* All bait attached to fishing rods will be changed to "water flea".
due to a change in how item data is handled.

Save data from Elona plus 1.18fix cannot be used in versions 1.18R and later.

When using a save file from Elona plus 1.22 or prior:
* Due to a change in how scrolls of flying work, the stats of all pieces of equipment in the inventories of the player character, pets, and adventurers will be reset. Their weight and equipment attributes stay the same, but other stats will become the highest value possible for the material that they are respectively made of.
Equipment that had ridiculous stats due to a bug in a previous version have to be fixed this way or you will not be able to equip them.
Alternatively, change the material of the piece of equipment and that will also fix it.

Save data from Elona plus 1.25 cannot be used in versions 1.25R and later.

Save data from Elona plus 1.38 cannot be used in versions 1.38R and later.

When using a save file from Elona plus 1.40 and 1.40fix, some body parts added onto your character or onto your pets may disappear.
Items equipped on those body parts will be unequipped.
When starting the game, an item to restore body parts will be placed at your character's feet.

When using a save file from Elona plus 1.40fix2, some body parts added onto your character may disappear.
Items equipped on those body parts will be unequipped.
When starting the game, an item to restore body parts will be placed at your character's feet.

When using a save file from Elona plus 1.85 or prior, the contents of placed shelters will be reset.
As such, a sand bag will be placed at your feet as it's a popular item to have in shelters.

When using a save file from Elona plus 1.88, 1.88R, and prior, constructed shelters will be deconstructed.
One toilet will also be placed at your feet.

When using a save file from Elona plus 1.97 or prior, pets who had been marked as precious will no longer be marked as such due to changes to the variable used. Custom item sprites will also have their image height reduced and appear flattened due to a change in the default parameters for sprite dimensions. You will need to reassign both of these after updating the game.

Save data from Elona plus 1.995 cannot be used in versions 2.00 and later.

Development versions of this game are for finding bugs. Versions that are fixes will fix bugs found in development versions before that, but that doesn't mean they are bug-free.

------------------------------

Recommended method for updating the game:
* The same as in vanilla Elona.
* Copy the save_CHARACTER folder from the /save folder into the /save folder of the new version.
* Play the new version of Elona plus.
* Any other custom files (e.g. character portraits) should be moved individually, not by copying their containing folder.
* You may want to have these custom files in a separate folder outside the game directory for ease of copying.

Not recommended:
* Copying all files and folders from the new version into the older version.
* Copying folders containing custom files and dropping them into the directory containing the new version.
* These may cause your game folder to have unnecessary files and other issues, so the game may not work if you do this.

------------------------------


==2.09==
'''1/16/2022'''
* Added a new guard break gauge that is purple in colour. When it exceeds 100%, PV and DV are temporarily set to 0.
** When it is less than 100%, it decreases by 1% per turn. While the player character is 'R'esting, it decreases by 2% per turn. When guard break ends, it is reset to 0% immediately.
** The gauge of characters who receive damage increases by 2%. This increase occurs only once per turn, and only if the gauge is less than 100%.
** PV/DV element attacks, however, now have a new effect - they increase the target's gauge by 10%.
** This should help prevent battles with enemies that heal themselves from getting repetitive, and it also means letting your guard down against a swarm of weak enemies can be deadly.

* While the player character is 'R'esting, all characters (i.e. the player character and all NPCs) will now recover HP, MP, and SP, and their guard break gauge will decrease.

* Light/Medium/Heavy Armor skill used to do nothing after level 300 - that cap has been removed. Instead, their effect on defence is now 1/4 of the previous value.

* Added 4 new giant race NPCs.

* Added 3 new rock race NPCs.

* Replaced Over Long Throw with a new special action.

* Added 3 new special actions.

* Replaced the Stone/Iron/Steel Defense feats with a new feat that grants the aforementioned special actions.
** Also replaced the Agile feats with something a lot more useful.

* Bewitch special action now causes a low amount of bleed. Could be a nosebleed or the character puking blood because of cuteness overload.

* Draw Shadow special action now also inflicts 1 turn of Invert.
** Similar special actions such as Dancing Wire, Dimension Fishing, and Multiple Gather do not have this effect.

* "Tell feelings" in the 'i'nteract menu will now consume 80% of the target's Attract - this change also applies to interactions with pets.
** Attract, by the way, fully recovers after 12 hours. Implementing a system where they recover Attract after sleep is difficult because NPCs on a different map wouldn't be able to recover.

* Added 1 new item that can be used as a substitute for sox for a quest.

* Stacking enough "absolute piercing attak" equipment attribute to make it proc 100% of the time with a weapon was too balance breaking and it's not quite what I had in mind for Elona plus. Besides, it leads to a lot of grinding too. As such, this equipment attribute's proc rate is now capped at 30%.

* Slaves and horses now have an empty inventory when purchased to save people the trouble of save scumming/stripping their inventory clean every time.

* Trash fished up in South Tyris and Lost Irva now have a different colour and name from trash fished up in North Tyris.
** Their selling price and size modifiers remain unchanged; the changes are purely cosmetic. This is just to spice up the different regions by introducing some differences between them.

* Traveling skill used to give small amounts of experience in several instalments, but having low potential meant that it would get rounded down, so it was possible to end up gaining less than 0.001 levels of experience sometimes.
** So instead of increasing the number of instalments [with distance travelled], the number of instalments is now fixed. Instead, the amount of experience per instalment increases [with distance travelled].

* Increased the rate of experience gained in the Doujyou per unit distance travelled to match that of the Traveling skill.
** Having the Traveling skill will not grant extra experience in the Doujyou.
** The cost of the "Special train allys" options has also been changed - it now depends on that student's INIT value. There is also no longer any discount for enrolling multiple students in the Doujyou. The cost is now 5 times that of training in towns (without any Charisma discount), and the effect is 6 times that of training in towns.
** This change should make the Doujyou somewhat decent for leveling pets safely, in exchange for gold pieces and any experience/AP that could've been gained in combat.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some descriptions.

* Fixed the descriptions of some of the new spellbooks added in 2.08 - some of them weren't properly edited after copy and pasting.

* Fixed Hydro Fang spell not making targets Wet.

* Fixed green teas redeemed with yaca points still spawning with +1 +enhance value.

* Fixed the issues that occurred when leaving a Harvest Time/Party Time/Trap disarming quest map while there is still time on the clock and time is currently stopped.

 [Note]
* The following change was present in the partial changelog posted while 2.09 was in development, but was missing in the changelog that came with 2.09's release even though 2.09 contains this new feature.

* Certain types of wilderness maps (i.e. Forest, Grassland, and Plain Field) now have a chance of generating a simple river.
** Forest maps have the highest chance of generating a river, and Plain Field maps have the lowest.
** The ambient sound effect [for rivers] is also slightly different on Forest maps.


==2.08fix==
'''12/23/2021'''
 [Fixes]
* Fixed the game crashing immediately after starting when the language is set to English. This was caused by a comma that was accidentally copy-pasted into the Anorexia status ailment label's English text.

* Added the "deals massive damage to metals" equipment attribute to the list of equipment attributes that living weapons can acquire.


==2.08==
'''12/19/2021'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added 14 new spells such that every element has a arrow, bolt, and ball version.
** Also made existing attack spells more consistent by making changes to their name, description, and MP cost.
** I've been putting this off since there was a lot of work involved, but it should be worth the effort if these spells help set characters apart from each other.

* Tentatively added the spellbooks for all arrow, bolt, and ball spells that haven't had one up until now.
** Also rebalanced their reading difficulties, levels, and market prices so that they're more consistent.

* Made musical notadpole, bell of emergency, mandrake, and zap mandrake corpses grant sound resistance.
** Halved the Magic attribute increases from the [corpses of the] two mandrake monsters.

* Sound-element damage now causes Dim instead of Confused so that illusion- and sound-element damage don't both cause the same status ailment.

* The side effects of chaos-element damage now proc in a predictable manner and are no longer random.
** It now inflicts the following:
** Wince, but at 1/7th the strength inflicted by fire-element damage,
** Chills, but at 1/7th the strength inflicted by cold-element damage,
** Blinded, but at 1/7th the strength inflicted by dark-element damage,
** Paralyzed, but at 1/7th the strength inflicted by nerve-element damage,
** Confused, but at 1/7th the strength inflicted by illusion-element damage,
** Dim, but at 1/7th the strength inflicted by sound-element damage, and
** Poisoned, but at 1/7th the strength inflicted by poison-element damage.

* Changed the calculation order for interlocking shooting mechanism and proximity assist weapon equipment attributes so that damage dealt doesn't overflow as easily.

* Added 1 new equipment attribute that deals extra damage to enemies with the metal bit flag.

* Decreased the cap on the healing effect of nether-element damage from 10% of maximum HP to 6.66% of current HP.
** Also decreased the chance of inflicting blindness to 60% of what it was.
** Added a "combine dark and nether spells" equipment attribute.

* When several arrow spells are casted in a row [by the exile], the "combine ____ spells" equipment attributes now apply. However, only the first arrow spell casted is affected.

* Added a bit flag to monsters that learn a ball spell upon evolving.
** Those who have already evolved will have that bit flag added to them whenever their stats are recalculated [such as when changing their equipment].

* Every character's bit flags are now listed in their "Feats and Traits" window.
** You can also tell whether a bit flag is granted by a piece of equipment or if it's intrinsic to the character.

* Changed the Suicide Attack special action so that the damage to the user now procs after the user's HP has been set to 0.
** This means no more chain of exploding bomb rocks in the Void.
** Also, characters hit by Suicide Attack will now get inflicted by 5 turns of Wince (that stacks on top of any existing Wince), and there is also a user Constitution-dependent chance of getting inflicted by Fear.

* Rebalanced the damage dealt by non-elemental attacks such as water spells and suicide attacks, and changed their element to the PV/DV element.
** Damage from these attacks can therefore now be reduced [by PV and DV] so they're unfortunately not as scary any more, but subjecting the player to unmitigable damage doesn't seem like a good idea balance-wise.

* Anorexia is now displayed as a status ailment on the left side of the screen when the player character is afflicted by it.
** The label will change accordingly to reflect the 11 different stages of seriousness (which is also the number of times the player character has vomited).
** The chance of recovering from anorexia when sleeping has also been improved.

* Changed the damage received when vomiting while satiety is negative to starvation damage.
** The damage calculation [for starvation] has also been changed. The greater the subject's Perception and the greater the number of times vomited (caps out at 30 times), the greater the damage received.
** In Purge mode, the damage received remains the unchanged (i.e. a fixed 999,999 damage is dealt).

* To prevent accidental use of memory converters, the item description has been made clearer and a confirmation dialogue now displays upon using it.

* The "360 rice balls and green teas" reward option from the yaca point card was worth more than I thought and overshadowed all the other options, so the green teas given no longer have +enhance values.
** The logic behind this is that +1 green teas are already worth too much and green teas without enhance values are still worth using.

* Send throw special action now searches the vicinity for a valid tile to throw the target to. As such, it no longer refuses to move the thrown character due to an inaccessible destination tile as often.
** It now displays who the thrown character has been thrown towards.

* Treasure maps aren't consumed when read, causing NPCs to get stuck in a loop reading them when they are handed one. Thus, NPCs no longer accept treasure maps.

* Changed some descriptions.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed the distance modifiers for various ranged attacks not getting applied for attacks at maximum range.

* Fixed one section of the code where I forgot to apply the fairy equipment weight limit change, causing equipment 1s and heavier to instantly get unequipped.

* Fixed the display issue that sometimes happened. This was because some NPC auto-turn actions caused them to act as if they were using the 0th item in the item list, and the bug triggered if that 0th item happened to be a food item and the player attempted to eat it.
** In addition to the fix for the aforementioned bug, when attempting to use an item that is currently in use by an NPC, the game now displays who exactly is currently using what item.


==2.07==
'''10/10/2021'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added the ability for some special actions and events to impose a "field state" upon the current map.
** A field state does not go away with time.
** A field state subjects characters on the map (including the one who imposed it) to some effects.
** Some field states can be removed by exiting and reentering the map or by the use of Space retention. These field states can also be overwritten by imposing a different field state.
** More field states to come in the future.

* Changed the display for attribute potential so that it now indicates two additional higher tiers - 300% and above, and 400% and above.
** This change does not affect the actual value of the potential.

* Also changed the display for resistance ranks so that it now indicates two additional higher tiers.
** The difference between each rank has also increased from 50 to 100, so the displayed resistances for existing characters will change.
** This change does not affect the actual value of the resistances.

* Swapped the Concentration feat for a new one. Added 4 new special actions related to it.

* Made Space retention special action learnable by the player character when prerequisites are met.

* Added the bit flag that makes an NPC always drop its gold on death to 2 NPCs that previously didn't have it but were capable of using the Suspicious Hand special action (i.e. catgod hand and terrorism squirrel).
** Also, NPCs with the summoned bit flag will now drop their gold when they have the gold dropping bit flag.

* It was possible to finish the the Act III last boss battle extremely quickly with certain tactics, so the additional damage done to it now procs only once per turn.

* To make fishing better at killing time, you now have the option to set it to auto-fish for 1 to 6 hours.
** When auto-fishing, the player character will resume fishing as long as there is bait on the fishing pole.
** When the set time has elapsed or when bait runs out, auto-fishing will stop.
** Bait is consumed only when something is fished up.
** With this, you can kill time and obtain fish while you're at it, but remember that fish rots in 8 hours.
** Ease of catching fish and the rate at which time passes while fishing remains the same. Machine lure, when used, will also work the same.

* Increased the chance that the [new] unique NPCs will visit your home to match that of the Mysterious Producer.

* Some attacks have their damage decreased by the target's PV and DV - that decrease has been decreased.

* Changed the effect of the Creepy Dream event.
** It now causes an extreme but temporary debuff to Perception, Will, and Luck. (The debuffs from multiple Creepy Dreams will stack.)
** This debuff can be prevented by the "protects [stat] from weakening" equipment attribute and with disinfectant.
** It can also be cured by Restore Spirit and healers in towns.
** This event no longer causes a permanent reduction in resistances.

* Buffed the predator class's perk - it now applies a 1.1x multiplier to its final calculated chance of doing a critical hit.

* Every race now has a multiplier to their final calculated chance that they can evade a critical attack.
** The smaller and weaker races have a higher multiplier. (e.g. For gods, it is 1.0x so it essentially remains unchanged; for snails, it is 3.0x.)
** This is to make things more even between races. Custom race names do not affect the multiplier.

* Increased the weight limit on equipment that player characters of the fairy race can wear to 2s. (Equipment weighing exactly 2.0s can be worn.)
** Fairy NPCs and the other seemingly feeble races have no such weight limit, but removing the cap altogether would probably make fairies too powerful and would mean removing their signature characteristic.

 [Fixes]
* The rent collection date variable was getting reused when it shouldn't be, so that variable has been changed to something else for two of the unique NPCs that visit your home.

* Fixed the HP bar display issue that sometimes occurred for pets.
** The issue happened when recalculating a pet's stats which caused the game to briefly remove bonuses to maximum HP (applied to {unique} and <mutant> NPCs) and PV/DV.

* Fixed stacking items in the inventory with the 'I' key not stacking manuscripts into lower-quality stacks.

* Fixed the crash that occurred in the English version when attempting to display tags meant for substituting parts of the Japanese dialogue for unique NPCs.

* Fixed the oblivion rude beast's Summon chaos special action not working.

* Fixed using a stack of filtration bottles causing the remaining charges of all bottles in that stack to decrease.
** It will now split one bottle from the stack and decrease only that bottle's charge.


==2.06fix==
'''8/17/2021'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Lowered the lower limit for Speed when Riding while having insufficient Strength and Riding skill. The minimum is now 1/10,000 of the steed's Speed, down from 1/10 of its Speed.

* Revamped how PV and DV bonuses for non-pet NPCs are calculated.
** Half of their level (capped at +200) is added to their PV and DV. [This step does not apply to pets] and is independent of race.
** The race bonus is then applied to the resulting value. This step applies to pets.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed race PV and DV bonuses not actually getting reflected in damage calculations.

* Fixed the issues with displaying characters during cutscenes while a portrait from user/graphic is in use.

* The new NPC's equip was supposed to reference the shotgun's ID, but I accidentally referenced its sprite ID instead, causing that NPC to end up spawning with the <Rail Gun> which has that ID.


==2.06==
'''8/15/2021'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added 4 unique NPCs that have a low chance of visiting your home.
** They may decide to stay depending on the options you pick.
** They don't count towards the limit on the number of stayers at your home but don't resurrect after dying.
** If you already have that NPC staying at your home, it won't visit.
** They're all kinda weird but are mostly harmless.

* Added an additional 6 new NPCs.

* Guests staying at your home will now roll to leave once per day instead of once every five days. The chance to leave per roll is now 50%, down from 80%.

* You will now hear cicadas in all towns other than Noyel during the months of July to September when the weather is fair.
** You won't hear cicadas in maps that aren't considered towns. Their cry changes depending on the date and time at which you entered town.
** From August to September, there will be dying cicadas on the ground in towns, with a higher chance for them to spawn during September.
** They're too distracting when starting a game, so new games now start in October instead of August.

* Added 14 new items.

* Considering the fact that the level cap of the Hero, Gem Power, Concentration, and Divine Wisdom spells is 2,000 and that their efficacy is boosted by Magic attribute, the additive component of the buffs that they give to their respective stats is now capped at 1,000.
** The multiplicative component of their buffs stills works the same as in previous versions.
** There is no cap on the number of turns their buffs will last.

* Now that there is a cap on the number of turns characters may take relative to each other, unique characters no longer deal bonus damage to opponents faster than them.
** They will still receive less damage [from these opponents] though.

* Increased the upper limit for Impress from 350 to 400.
** The Impress value is now always visible instead of displaying "???".

* When an NPC at full health chooses to use any healing spell (other than Healing Rain), it will now have up to 2 additional chances that turn to try to pick another move to make.

* In order to prevent monsters far stronger than the player from getting summoned by the Summon Monsters spell due to spell power buffs, the types of monsters summoned is now limited by the caster's level.
** Enemies generally don't use Summon Wild so that spell remains the same.

* Halved the spawn rate of enemies in the Kamikaze attack and Mission from Karavika sub quests.
** The former will now also have a siren than sounds when the mission is cleared.

* Gave varying PV or DV bonuses to several weak or average races.
** After updating the game, these bonuses will get applied to existing NPCs when the player 'i'nteracts with them.

* The PV and DV of non-pet NPCs is now listed in their inventory in the top right corner when Pickpocketing them.

* The displayed PV and DV values of all characters now includes their race bonuses as well as any bonuses that enemy NPCs have.

* Stamina loss that occurs due to Drying! and Need Sleep! statuses will no longer occur when stamina is already -100 or lower to prevent it from getting too low.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed conversation windows not showing custom portraits located in user/graphic.

* Fixed gold pieces spawning from [quaffing] well-type items overriding any gold pieces that were already on that tile.

* Characters with the bit flag that makes them immune to elemental damage no longer receive halved fire-elemental damage when Wet.

* Fixed damage received from fires on the ground not being affected by Oil status.

* Changed the condition under which the cthulhick evolution will use Alchemical Rain. It used to use the special action when its target was not Wet; it will now use it when the cthulhick itself is not Wet.

* Fixed failing Amurdad's side quest the first time causing the player to never receive the artifact reward for subsequent successful attempts.
** When updating the game, the quest triggers for this quest will be reset.


==2.05==
'''6/6/2021'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added some English translations I received.

* After thinking about it, a 20x speed difference in a roguelike seems to be a bit too much. When enemies have that kind of advantage, it feels too unfair. When players have the advantage, brute force becomes the answer to everything.
** Hence, the range in frequency of NPCs' turns relative to the player is now capped at 1/5 to 5, and not 1/20 to 20.
** Higher Speed still translates to more turns against an opponent so it remains an important attribute.

* Implemented Amurdad's Act III side quest.
** A part of it can be tricky, but it shouldn't be difficult if you pay attention and think things through carefully.

* New unique artifacts that drop from every Act's final boss.
** For save data from previous versions, these artifacts will be placed at your character's feet after updating the game.

* Added [several] new unique artifacts that can be received from Sophia after clearing Act III.

* Also added 2 more new items.

* Added 1 new option to the conversation with bartenders.

* Slightly reduced the effect of the special dish available at inns, but extended its duration by a significant amount.
** It is now also applied to all pets you have with you and not just to the ones in sight.

* Increased the damage dealt by fires on the ground.
** Fires that spread from a parent fire will now inherit the parent fire's strength.

* Museums now come with a register.
** This applies only to newly-constructed museums.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed cancelling while telling an informer your birthday setting it to 0/0.


==2.04==
'''4/25/2021'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added 4 new NPCs.

* Added 2 new special actions.

* "Sexless" is now sex "unknown" as the latter has a broader definition.
** Added it as an option during character creation.
** Now characters can start as male?, female?, bisexual, and unknown.

* Prevented the tag team organizing window from showing up for characters already in a tag team and for those who cannot be put in one.
** Removed the "Tag organization" option from the 'i'nteract menu for pets already in a tag team. 

* Characters without a full-body portrait set (i.e. atmosphere/'Tatie') will now display their zoomed-in sprite and not their zoomed-in portrait after selecting certain evochat options.

* Added a new "tag evochat" option to the conversation window for pets who are in a tag team.
** The target's partner will also need to satisfy the prerequisites for evochat to happen.
** The tag partner's reaction will be displayed before the target's.
** The portraits for both pets will be displayed side by side after certain options are selected.
** This cannot be used on pets who are in a tag team with the player character. Passing them 100k gold will make the pets split it between themselves.

* Added a new "Talk to your tag team partner." option to the conversation window for pets who are in a tag team.
** Customizable with txtTag. If there are several lines of text under that header, a random line will be picked so make sure that they don't clash with each other.
** Also added a new <evochat without you> option that will only show up during the aforementioned "tag evochat". This one is customizable with txtTagEvo.
** In past versions, evochat has focused on player-pet interactions, but pet-pet interactions are now possible with this feature.
** You can watch your pets make out with each other or you can join in.
** Neither of these are usable on a pet tagged with the player character.

* Added special tags that can be used in custom talk files that range from {se0} to {se99}.
** Placing a seN.wav (replace 'N' with the tag's number) sound file in the user/sound folder will cause that sound to be played [when a line of text with that tag is spoken.]
** Placing several tags into a line of text will cause all of their sounds to get played at the same time.
** This means you can make cats meow when making them wait in town, or play a gun reloading sound effect for pets engaging in battle. You can even record entire lines and play them out.
** Of course, creating all these .wav files is a lot of trouble and some may find it too noisy, but to each their own.

* The conversation window was getting crowded out by the list of options, so the "I tell you my feelings" option has been moved into the 'i'nteraction menu.
** May I ask for your hand/Let's make a gene options are now sub-options for the aforementioned.
** You can now tell your feelings to non-pet NPCs to raise their Impress.
** But you won't be able to marry them even when Impress is high enough.

* Non-pet NPCs will now heal [like pets and the player character] while the player character sleeps.

* Made slight changes to the conversation that occurs as Lomias and Larnneire leave the cave after finishing the tutorial.
** Changed the items given. A fixed set of 4 useful items is now given instead of 3 random furniture pieces.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed the crash that sometimes occurred when loading a save if the game was saved while in the arena.

* Fixed memory converter not being consumed upon use even though it was described explicitly as a single-use item.

* Fixed the error that occurred when a powerful great wyrm summoned more powerful great wyrms. This occurred because of a section of code that dealt with NPCs summoning more NPCs of their type.

* Fixed the portrait swap that could occur when entering Zaile for the first time.

* Fixed Melt Clinch special action not being considered as an attack.

* Opponents in a duel can no longer be Dominated.
** Not that there's any point in duelling an NPC you're going to Dominate anyway.
** The NPC will now be treated as if it were one of those unrecruitable NPCs until the duel ends, and as such Dominate will inflict Paralysis instead.


==2.03==
'''2/14/2021'''
 [Changes and additions]
* 5 new items.

* And 1 new unique artifact, available for exchange from Miral.

* 6 new special actions.

* 5 new hand race NPCs. 2 new evolutions.

* 4 new drake race NPCs.

* Changed the conditions under which the evolved NPCs "witch" (NB: no English equivalent) and "red cross" will use their Rain of sanity special action.
** It used to be 100% for the witch and 50% for red cross when the player's insanity is 1 or greater.
** It is now 20% when its insanity or the player's insanity is 10 or greater.

* Changed the AI of two existing unique NPCs. This change affects instances of those NPCs from existing saves.

* Increased the amount of experience given by debris, but halved the base number awarded by clearing Nefia.
** An additional +1 debris is then awarded if the Nefia cleared was awakened.
** An additional +1 debris is also given for Nefia cleared during Nefia fever.

* Changed the lower bound of MP to -99,999.

* Changed the damage calculation for Meteor spell.
** In previous versions, not only did its damage increase steeply with Magic attribute, it also had a Magic-dependent modifier on top of that, sometimes leading to overflow issues.
** Magic attribute no longer affects damage as much, so overflow won't occur even when casted by a maxed-out character on a target affected by Element Scar and drenched in oil.

* Added the English translations for Adventure Seminar that I received quite a while ago.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some typos.

* Fixed OverLimit-Throw buff as it was also working on melee attacks.

* Set the attack roll dice minimum to 1 because of the crash that occurred when attempting to roll with 0.


==2.02==
'''12/30/2020'''
 [Changes and additions]
* A new Act III sub quest from Garziem.
** There is no penalty for failing it and I highly recommend not reading any spoilers in the detailed changelog for maximum enjoyment.

* 4 new map tiles.

* Put 2 previously-unused BGM songs to use.

* As preparation for a future feature, from version 2.02 onwards, the game will keep track of the number of potions consumed.
** Only potions that have a round-bottomed flask as their sprite will be counted.
** Potions quaffed, thrown, used (doused), mixed, and consumed in Alchemical Rain/Liquid Manipulation by the player are counted.
** Potions used by NPCs and those consumed during item fusion are not counted.

* Divine Wisdom (the spell that buffs Magic attribute) spell power is now independent of Magic attribute. This spell is the only one that has a spell power that that works this way.
** Divine Wisdom's spell power is still affected by the ["enchances your spells"] equipment attribute.

* Reduced the difference in base power between arrow, bolt, and ball-type spells. To be precise, their base power is now closer to that of bolt-type spells, which is in middle in terms of power.
** Arrow-type spells are also simpler to cast, so their spell power increases more easily with Magic attribute.
** Ball-type spells are more advanced, so their spell power increases more easily with their respective spell levels and the Casting skill level.
** Again, bolt-type spells are in the middle. Given the same [skill and attribute levels], all types of spells will do more or less the same amount of damage.

* NPCs that are of 'unique' quality now have an additional property:
** Damage received from an enemy that has a higher Speed attribute is reduced by a multiplier dependent on the ratio of their Speed (at maximum reduction, damage is reduced to 1/5 of normal value.)
** Damage dealt to an enemy with a higher Speed is increased depending on the ratio of their Speed (up to a maximum of x5 damage).
** This balances out difference in speed.
** Will also work for pets.

* Spellbooks now recover a constant amount of spell stock, instead of recovering an amount that drastically decreased with current stock.
** This means that it's no longer more efficient to use up all spell stock before reading another spellbook.
** The amount of spell stock gained and Memorization skill experience gained have also been greatly increased.

* Made some table furniture usable.
** They can now be used to do some things like write books.
** Tables from saves from previous versions of Elona+ will not work.
** Travelling on the world map has a chance of giving ideas (chance is increased by Traveling skill), which can then be used to write books.

* Children resulting from alien pregnancies now spawn 0 years old.
** Also, when characters in towns impregnated by a sunbararian give birth, their children will [be the size of a] child and be disguised as a citizen. (The child will not, however, be named "child of ___" [like children resulting from a normal alien pregnancy].)

 [Fixes]
* Fixed the issue with the first character to take a turn after sprinkling bait in a ranch.

* The potion's quaff effect is no longer applied when enemies die from Liquid Manipulation damage.

* The NPC from version 2.01 that was supposed to be placed upon clearing Act III was present regardless of the quest progress variable, so the NPC has been given some pre-Act III clearing dialogue.

* To prevent crashes, "Original [appearance]" can no longer be selected from the menu for characters who have non-animated sprites and are currently under the effect of a shift core.
** Characters under the effect of a shift core also can no longer be evolved.
** Also fixed the issue with displaying the custom sprite of an NPC who has a default sprite ID of 1,000 or greater.

* Fixed the bug that prevented the year from being correctly looked up, causing anniversary events to not happen when waking up.

* Fixed the game not being to place objects on certain passable tiles when the player enters the map.

* Fixed "Decorative arts shop" shop types being unable to sell furniture.

* When entering a map that has no space to place a pet, the pet gets randomly placed somewhere else. However, it could result a crash when it randomly placed only one member of a tag team. To fix this, when randomly placing one member of a tag team, the other will now also be randomly placed as well.

* Fixed time not passing faster in shelters during bad weather. Also made a slight change to the rate at which time passes [when passing time quickly].

* Fixed the crash the occurred when an NPC with a full inventory uses  the Alchemical Rain or Liquid Manipulation special actions.
** If the NPC's inventory is full, it will just end its turn [instead of using the aforementioned special actions] now.


==2.01==
'''10/25/2020'''
 [Changes and additions]
* 1 new unique NPC is now placed in Shrine of Guardian upon clearing Act III.

* Added a bit of post-Act III dialogue to NPCs relevant to the story.

* After considering the importance of skill bonus points, spell bonus points, and debris in planning a character build, growing said character according to the build, and also how easy they are to use, the amount of experience they grant is no longer tripled by training days and Advanced Casting.

* 10 debris is now awarded when a random Nefia is cleared [instead of 3].

* Removed the 1.5x satiety increase modifier for blessed foods.
** Also increased the effect of lucky days caused by blessed foods and the amount of insanity recovered.

* Set an upper limit for damage dealt by exploding handmade chocolate.

* Greatly increased the amount of Evasion, Greater Evasion, and Riding skill experience earned when successfully dodging a physical attack.
** However, no experience will be received unless the attacker's relevant skills are higher than the target's Evasion skill level.
** Greatly increased the amount of Shield skill and armour skill experience received when receiving a physical attack.
** However, no experience will be received unless the amount of damage received is at least 1% of the maximum HP of the target.
** In short, the experience calculation is similar to what it was in previous versions, except that there's no randomness to it now, the prerequisites for earning experience have been relaxed, and the amount of experience received increases with the difference in skill level between attacker and target.
** It's now a lot more efficient to fight and get hit by an enemy that actually poses a threat instead of standing there and letting a weak one pummel you.

* Trap removal town board quests now have about 1/2 as many traps, and the quota has also been reduced to about a 1/3.
** Remove at least 1.25 times the quota to receive a bronze coin as a reward.
** The size of the quest map remains the same.

* The player character's speed now has less of an effect on the speed at which time passes. Slower races therefore now have more time to complete quests in early game.

* The character sheet now lists spell power modifier in the bottom right corner.

* The number of dice for attack spells is no longer increased by spell power. They now behave like a lot of other spells - only their dice range will be increased when spell power increases.

* Removed the Casting skill level-dependent spell power modifier for spells casted [but not for rods zapped] by non-pet NPCs.
** Added a Magic attribute-dependent spell power modifier for spells casted and rods zapped.
** This modifier is capped at a maximum of +300% spell power, reached when Magic attribute is 1,500 or greater. It is a separate modifier that works independent of the spell power modifier from the ["enchances your spell"] equipment attribute that has a maximum of +100% spell power modifier.

* Rods (the usable magic devices) now have their spell power increased when buffed by Magic Equip.

* Rods (the usable magic devices) now use Magic Device and Magic Capacity skill levels and Learning attribute to calculate spell power.
** In previous versions, they used Magic Device skill level and Magic and Perception attributes.
** Now use of rods depends on 2 skills and utilizes a couple of the underused stats.

* Magic Capacity skill feels underused even with the above change, so it now gives a bonus to the number of charges drawn and filled by Draw Charge and Fill Charge.
** The chance of preventing a rod from exploding during Fill Charge now depends on Magic Capacity instead of Control Magic. (Caps out at 99.5% chance of preventing explosion.)
** Draw Charge and Fill Charge usage now grants [Magic Capacity] skill experience.
** Decreased the amount of experience given by magic reaction. (Maximum is now given at -100% MP.)
** The skill can now also reduce the effect of the MPoison status ailment.

* Use of shift cores now costs nothing when power gauge is at 50% or more.

* Reading ancient books grants 10x as much Abyss power now.

* Using a dark fragment now grants 1 Abyss power.
** Added 3 new items that can be made from dark fragments in item fusion. 

* Added an "Outta the way" option to the conversation window with friendly non-unique NPCs.
** (NB: Mistranslated as "I want you to investigate one of my allies." in game.)
** Selecting it will make it swap positions with the player character. Use when a citizen is blocking your path or something.
** Using it spends Attract. When Attract is 0, the NPC refuses to budge. Use of this is not unlimited so that NPCs can't be herded to a particular location.

* Distracted debuff from tobacco dependence now lasts 1/10 as many turns.
** Melancholy debuff from drug dependence now lasts 1/4 as many turns, so it's easier to quit now.

* Changed the description of the "maintains ______" attribute equipment attribute to "protects ______ from weakening".
** Just so that new players don't misinterpret it and think that it prevents those attributes from leveling up.

* [Lowered] the threshold for the amount of experience needed to be earned in order to gain potential when sleeping.

* Spell potential gained when sleeping will now be dependent on the amount of experience earned before sleeping.
** A very meagre amount will be gained by a character who does nothing but sleep, while a character that goes on adventures will gain about twice as much spell potential compared to past versions.

* Emergency Evasion now prevents critical hits from occurring instead of evading critical hits 100% of the time.
** The user then rolls to evade the regular attack that happens in place of the critical hit.
** Increased the number of turns Emergency Evasion lasts for.

* When a character evolves, it is now fully healed. All status ailments are also removed, and power gauge becomes 200%.
** Because it's more exciting to evolve in combat.

* Reduced the rate at which Blood Stream special action's damage increases with the strength of bleed status ailment.

* Changed how some equipment attributes work when the item they're on is eaten.

 [Fixes]
* Made it easier to make progress during a certain Act III event boss battle.

* Fixed the crash that occurred when using a rod of alchemy while the gauge is full enough to use a gauge attack, and the game tries to decide if the gauge attack for stave weapons should proc.


==2.00fix==
'''9/13/2020'''
 [Fixes]
* Fixed entering 15F Rehmido for the first time in version 2.00 taking the user to the wrong map and causing the player to be unable to progress with the main quest.
** Reentering 15F in this version will regenerate the floor and fix the main quest trigger.
** This bug was caused by overwriting the wrong file when working on 2.00.

* Fixed the crash that sometimes occurred when the player character has no spells/special actions/wide special actions to hide and the player attempts to hide an item in the list after tabbing over to the current list.


==2.00==
'''9/05/2020'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added final boss battle and the ending.
** With this, the main quest is finally done. Naturally, people who haven't been following along still won't understand the story though.
** The code for this is fairly complicated, I highly recommend backing up your save data before attempting the new content [in case of bugs].
** Next to be worked on is post-game content and the various features that have been left on the back burner.

* Shortened the number of turns needed between cutscenes in an Act III event boss battle by quite a fair bit.

* Changed how skill-training days are selected. If the skill-training trigger for the previous day has been activated, it will select the next one in a list.
* If it has not been activated or if all skill-training triggers have already been activated, a random skill-training day will be picked.

* The character sheets of allied characters (includes pets, summoned undead, and friendly NPCs in quests and such) are now viewable by selecting an option when 'i'nteracting with them. This also allows you to spend their bonus points.
** Informers will now offer info about adventurers instead.

* Analysis immediately reaches 100 when using an insight lens on a hostile NPC.

* Information on adventurers costs 100 gold at an informer, and their character sheet can be viewed by selecting them from the list shown.
** This should make their individual characteristics more apparent. They may also belong to a guild or worship a particular god - these are also displayed on their character sheet.
** The list of adventurers now display their Impress instead of their level.

* The character sheets of character other than the player character and pets no longer have their karma.
** The karma of pets is now always the same as the player's.
** Character sheets of NPCs other than pets and adventurers will not display the guild they belong to.
** Non-pet NPCs will now have fame - also viewable - based on their level and character quality. When recruited [as a pet], their fame drastically falls.

* Pets who have won in the pet arena will gain fame themselves. They do not lose fame after losing a battle.

* Edited the descriptions of several items to make their effect clearer.

* To make the various types of chests more valuable, bejeweled chests now have a 100% chance and regular chests a 25% chance of yielding 1 herb.
** Regular chests also have a 50% chance and safes a 25% chance of yielding 1 bronze coin.
** Reduced the range in quality of spawned items [from opening chests].

* Changed the calculation for AP cost of increasing Speed and Life. It is now based on the starting value, not the current value.
** It is now a fair bit more expensive at the beginning compared to previous versions, but this cost will never increase.
** This is so that players don't need to hold off on evolving pets until they have bought all the upgrades they can with AP to lower costs.
** The player character's Speed will now increase in increments of 30.

* The Wet status counter no longer decreases while standing on a water tile.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some descriptions.


==1.995R==
'''6/28/2020'''
 [Fixes]
* Fixed weapon skills not getting marked by icons in the skill list on Training-day.
** Also made spell list have icons when Adv-Cast is on.

* Fixed receiving a small amount of Memorization skill experience from evade calculation even when not in combat.


==1.995==
'''6/28/2020'''
  [Changes and additions]
* Added a new mechanic: DESTINY triggers. Activating 7 of these triggers causes 3 Godly pieces of equipment to spawn on the piles of gold pieces in random Nefia. (Since there are multiple items, they'll appear as a bag.)
** This is to increase the relevance of Nefia and make it easier to gear up large parties of pets with elemental resist equips.
** As triggers are activated, letters are added to a display in the top-left corner beside the date.

* Rate of increase in cost and the maximum cost in platinum pieces for skill training and magic practice have been approximately halved.
** Panic quests gave a lot more platinum pieces than other quests, so the maximum payout has been reduced to 6.
** The rate at which the number of platinum pieces paid by Panic quests increases with fame remains unchanged.
** Skill bonus and spell bonus points now increase potential by a fixed 20% instead of a random amount between 2% and 15%.

* No platinum pieces/skill bonus/spell bonus points will be earned when your character already has 100 or more of it.
** This cap works only to prevent any additional gains above 100; pp/points above the cap that a character already has will not be confiscated.
** A warning sound will play and a log message will display in red when exceeding 100 and whenever it is already above 100.
** This is to reduce hoarding of platinum pieces so that players don't inadvertently end up handicapping themselves. It should ensure that characters grow at a constant pace, and minimize the need for grinding so that players don't get bored or stuck in Act I or II.
** They go over the limit a lot more easily on Overdose and Purge modes, and players are probably brute-forcing all the enemies anyway even if they're imposing some kind of handicap on their playthrough. As such, there will be no cap for these two game modes.

* The player's Record section in the journal now has the number of skill bonus and spell bonus points earned so far.
** This number is cumulative so it does not decrease after spending. When updating the game from a previous version, the number of points the character already has will be added to the starting count.
** If you have blown up any rogue ambushes with the land battleship, that number will also be recorded.
** The journal will also record total arena and pet arena wins instead of current win streaks. This is to reflect the change in the way arenas work and also so that players don't save scum to preserve their win streak.

* Removed the feature that had a Learning attribute-dependent chance of increasing skill experience gained.
** This is so that players don't have to hoard resources until the Learning attribute is high enough, or save scum until the skill experience increase procs.

* The number of times skill potentials are increased for players and pets when waking up now depends on amount of experience gained.
** There is now also a Learning attribute-dependent chance of doubling potential gain for each separate skill.
** However, this doubling will occur only if the rare loot trigger is on.

* Skill experience gained is tripled for different sets on skills on different days.
** This is to decrease repetitiveness, increase the need for planning ahead, and to make up for the removal of the Learning attribute-dependent experience bonus.
** The current group of skill is indicated beside the date, and each skill in this group by an icon in the skill list.

* Increased the duration of effect of Necro Force 'W'ide special action. It will also grant an Attribution Shield buff to buffed undead now.
** Undead restore will now also grant Regeneration buff to undead.
** The strength of both of these buffs depend on the player character's Control Magic skill level. When used, they give Control Magic experience per every undead buffed.

* Reduced the amount of gold earned by pets when selling ores to 80% of the base price.
** There is then a small amount of gold added to it, dependent on Negotiation skill (Negotiation skill effect is not capped at any number).
** The amount also has a multiplier to it, dependent on Jeweler skill (Jeweler skill effect is capped at level 300).

* Evasion stat is now decreased when standing on a water tile while Wet.
** However, this decrease is ameliorated by Swimming skill, and at high levels may even cause evasion stat to increase instead.
** The evasion stat is the one seen on the character sheet, so use that to check how much your evasion is increased/decreased.
** This is simulate aquatic animals' advantages in water.
** The increase in Speed given by [Swimming] skill was too high, and has been decreased from 50% to 40% of skill level.

* Changed how Artifact lottery works to remove the bias in results.

* Bed rank is indicated in their item description, but beginners won't know how good or bad the beds in town are. As such, the approximate quality of a bed the player character is standing on is now indicated in the log.

* Slightly modified how the descriptions of cards in a deck are displayed. Also made it work in the English version, and added just a bit of translation.

* Also incorporated some other translations.

* Clarified the UI for inventory mode swapping.

* Added Decorative arts shop and Junk shop to the shop types that your shop can be set to.
** It would've been nice if the shop type selection matched the types of NPC shops, but making sure all items had their own type came first.

* To make skills useful in more situations, Sense Quality skill has been renamed as Analysis in both the Japanese and English versions.
** When receiving a regular attack (both getting hit and evading it will work) it will add to an analysis counter. The higher the receiver's Analysis skill, the faster the analysis counter increases.
** The receiver's ability to evade the attacker's attacks increases as the counter increases. Memorization skill increases the effect.
** Enemies have a circular gauge displayed with their HP bar that displays their analysis counter in increments of 20.
** The analysis counter will increase even faster for characters who also have the Memorization skill.
** The analysis counter does not get reset when moving to a different map, so when used in conjunction with Defense mode it may be helpful for scouting out bosses that use physical attacks.
** Added a new special action related to this mechanic.
** For roleplaying analytical characters and stuff.

* Characters in Defense mode now gain a Constitution attribute and Shield skill-dependent increase in evade.

* Decreased the chance that the Dream? sleep event will occur.

* Successfully decoding ancient books now give a rank-dependent amount of Abyss power.
** There are is no use for Abyss power at the moment, but you can start accumulating it now.
** A use for it should come in the future - hopefully as a reference to something.
** For giving non-Mages Guild members a reason to decode ancient books without making Mages Guild members choose between one of those uses.

 [Fixes]
* The custom text txtDialogH is not enclosed by quotation marks [unlike txtMizuAsobi], the contents didn't match up to the very special session of tail you just had, and it was just inconsistent. Thus, instead of txtdialogH, use the new TxtMizuAsobiEnd for customizing the text spoken at the end of the little tail session.

* Fixed the year check for initiating birthday event.
** Also made the informer display the birthday you've registered with them when the same option is selected.

* Fixed gauge attacks that aren't procs (i.e. the gauge attacks that only certain NPCs have) activating in Intercept battle mode when they shouldn't.

* Fixed the sprites for flesh dolls of some wider or taller NPCs getting cut off.

* Fixed fires from thrown suigara burning indefinitely until put out.
** Existing fires from previous versions won't go out, so please put those out manually with potions or by other means.

* Fixed the game using a shop's display tiles as display tiles for all other shops if the player is in that shop when determining items to be sold.

* Fixed summoned undead sometimes falling asleep when entering a town at night.
** This is a different fix from the one in 1.56 that stopped them from falling asleep after a few turns at night in town.

* Fixed the code for generating the large figurine sprites that would also fetch the sprite for a panty because it was fed a larger-than-expected range of values to lookup, causing a panty to appear on top of a shaved ice.
** ...people are probably going to be even more confused after reading this.

* Fixed some map data.

* Fixed swamp tiles on the world map acting like roads.

* Fixed healing rain animation playing for characters out of its area of effect.

* Fixed using a high potion of wisdom with alchemical rain attempting to play the animation for the high potion for all characters and the shortened alchemical rain animation at the same time, causing the game to act as if Effect Speed had been set to 0.

 [Unofficial changelog pertaining to English version]

** Herb Effect: stomafilia's speed increase added, some minor edits
** Shopkeeper Guide: Yaca points paragraph added
** Easy Gardening: rewritten from scratch
** Mission Briefing: Talking directive added

==1.99==
'''6/28/2020'''
 [Changes and additions]
* To make skills level up faster and as an additional reward for challenging Nefia, a new item has been added as the reward for clearing one.

* Rebalanced the distance-dependent damage modifier for all ranged attacks.
** This damage modifier will no longer drastically decrease the damage dealt outside the weapon's preferred distance-from-target.
** Instead, this damage modifier will act to slightly increase damage when at the weapon's preferred distance-from-target.
** The distance-dependent accuracy modifier remains unchanged.

* Enemy HP tends to get too high at extreme levels, so the rate of HP increase will decrease at levels 1000, 2000, and 3000.

* Added a new red book about quests. Does not spawn randomly, and is found beside the job board in Vernis.
** Added another new red book about fishing. Does not spawn randomly, and is found in front of the fisher shop in Vernis.
** For save files from previous versions of the game, the books will be placed there when the town does its periodic refresh.

* Some skills are found on very few monsters making it difficult to gene engineer them on to your pets. Also, most races give bonuses to only 2 skills or fewer (the exceptions being gods and snail).
** Thus, some races now give bonus skill levels in more skills. This will not affect NPCs generated in a previous version of the game.

* Alchemical Rain special action now affects only characters allied to the user.
** When used by an NPC, it will now generate an uncursed and unblessed potion of restore spirit in their inventory, then use that potion for Alchemical Rain.
** The potion animation will also [not play] for every affected target.

* Added a new special action that acts like Alchemical Rain but works solely on enemies.
** This and the above changes allows players to selectively apply potions, allowing them to be used more effectively in combat.

* Added 2 new evolutions.

* Increased the SP regeneration when hydration level is Wetting or above from 2SP/10 turns to 5SP/10 turns.
** It will still regenerate SP during auto turns, unlike the passive trait from worshipping Kumiromi.

* In previous versions, when gene engineering a pet with the same or a greater number of a body part as the target pet it's going to be fused into, sometimes - depending on the source pet's ID - the target pet would not gain the extra body parts.
** On closer examination, this isn't a feature to prevent asura and mitra from donating more hands but rather a random number generation seeded with monster ID that just happened to exclude monsters like those.
** Thus, this gene engineering restriction has been relaxed.

* Using Suspicious Hand on NPCs strung up on a sandbag will now automatically fail to nick the target's wallet because the rope's too tight.

* NPCs with the summoned monster bit flag don't drop money on death, so they will now perform a regular attack instead whenever attempting to use Suspicious Hand.

* In addition to the above change, NPCs with the bit flag that causes them to drop the gold they have (NB: cDropGold) will now drop all their gold.
** Also fixed the issue where gold dropped from NPCs without that bit flag did not match the reduction in gold they have.

* Increased the amount of time before fish obtained from fishing rot from 4h to 8h.
** The time taken for fish not obtained from fishing to rot remains the same.

* Updated the list of cards acquirable from card packs to match the current version of the game.

* Updated the Japanese version of Museum Guide, Herb Effect, Shopkeeper Guide, Easy Gardening, Mission Briefing, You dig mining?, and the Adventure Seminar.

* Any bonus to cargo limit added by the vehicle will now be subtracted and ignored when calculating the cost of upgrading the cart.
** The cargo limit is now displayed together with the current cargo weight.

* The suigara item will now disappear 100% of the time after being thrown instead of having only a chance to get burnt up.

* Dungeons (created from deeds of dungeon) can now be relocated with the property transfer deed.

* Sub quests that require a certain amount of fame will now display the required amount of fame within the conversation window, instead of requiring the player to look it up on the internet.

* The current pace of the game makes it so that the player is far stronger than required for the Rule of Ninja sub quest by the time the requisite amount of fame is reached, so the amount of fame needed has been halved.

* Made <Milis> the soldier easier to find in Eirel by creating a new path in town and making newly-spawned instances of the NPC immobile.

* 'l'ooking at characters now displays their current SP as a percentage instead of an exact number. One of the reasons for this change is to make it match HP and MP displays which you can't determine as precisely for NPCs.

* Prevented the dialogue box from popping up when the network setting is on even if no server is indicated.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some descriptions.

* Fixed the South Tyris Nefia boss's info being available from town informers before Act II even begins.

* Fixed using up 1 pet arena entry chance if you cancel when selecting who to send out in the pet arena.

* Fixed entering a number from 28 to 32 when changing the world map icon of a deed making it into inaccessible terrain.
** Also made number 33 selectable.
** There will be some visual glitches when in Aimwell because of how the code works, but they can be fixed by going to North Tyris and returning.

* Fixed the issue with orichal-co's base level.

* Fixed the [character] targeting for the new Healing Rain animation.

* Fixed maps that have NPCs placed on them by game triggers sometimes placing those NPCs twice. This occurred if the player has never visited the map before the game trigger activated, and a map refresh occurs at the same time as the visit.


==1.98R==
'''4/12/2020'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Pressing the 's' key while riding in a vehicle on the world map will now play a sound. It doesn't do anything else, so spam it all you want.

* Changed the way Blade Turbulence, [Healing Rain], Rain of sanity, and Homing Lazer are animated.

* Halved the price of ordering a drink from a bartender.

* Greatly increased the amount of hydration recovered when Wet while hydration is below a certain value.

* The default sprite for traveler's food has something that looks like a drink pictured in it. Thus, eating a traveler's food when hydration is low will now recover hydration by approximately the same amount as drinking a regular potion.
** Automatic usage of traveler's food will still only trigger when satiety is low and not when thirsty.

* The scroll of growth item and Development sleep event no longer work on a number of random skills; they now work on all skills that the character has learned.
** This is so that having useless skills won't cause the potential increase of other skills to decrease.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed the graphical issue with stairs in all maps other than West Raskilis valley that would temporarily crop up when entering said location.

* Fixed eye-race NPCs' evolutions not getting assigned the bit flag that indicates a sprite ID of 1000 and above, causing issues with their post-evolution sprite.
** Eye race pets that were evolved in a previous version will be automatically patched when updating to this version if they are in your list of pets [and not in the discarded ranch or Doujyou].

* Fixed reading a vehicle deed on the world map consuming the deed.

* Also fixed the increased cargo capacity that vehicles gave, which was off by a magnitude. Existing save files will be automatically patched when updating the game.

* Fixed on-character sprites for equipment like armours and cloaks becoming invisible when entering another map.


==1.98==
'''4/06/2020'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Changed some Act II main quest cutscenes.
** Fleshed out some details, added some foreshadowing, slightly changed how events unfold, added some characters to them, and so on.

* Added 4 means of transportation for travelling on the world map.
** Added deeds for each of these.

* 2 more conversation options for pets.
** The pet's reaction to one of them can be customized with txtMizuAsobi.

* Renamed the "maintenance" item in the tax breakdown to "running costs" [in the Japanese version] as the latter has a broader definition.

* Changed the icons of some warning messages to ones that stand out more so that fewer people overlook the messages.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed the issue with the options displayed when the Riding special action is used.

* Making a pet wait in town while it is currently being ridden will now cause your player character to properly dismount from it.

* Fixed all evolved pets sometimes using Dancing Wire on the lower level eye race targets.
** Also fixed the new evolution added in 1.97 not using Dancing Wire like she is supposed to.
** These issues arose because the ID of the target was used instead of the user.

* Fixed the item marks set for characters on the right side of a tag team being off by 3 pixels to the side.

* Fixed one of the new ether disease symptoms decreasing Charisma instead of increasing it (the code was copied from the "your neck becomes extremely thick" symptom).


==1.97==
'''3/01/2020'''
When updating to version 1.97, pets who had been marked as precious will no longer be marked as such due to changes to the variable used.

Custom item sprites will also have their image height reduced and appear flattened.

You will need to reassign both of these after updating the game.

 [Changes and additions]
* 4 new unique artifacts. Some available for exchange, some randomly spawned.

* Added just the conversation before the last boss battle of Act III.

* 5 new eye race NPCs. 2 new evolutions.

* The "sores on your face" ether disease symptom now has a maximum Charisma penalty of -999 at every disease stage.
** The "you suffer debilitation" and "you are stupid" symptoms have a maximum penalty of -255 to Strength and Magic respectively.

* Decreased the satiety gain from using Voracity Fang special action to 1/10 of the previous value.
** When satiety is at Satisfied or above, using this special action will just do a regular physical attack.

* 10 new ether disease symptoms.
** These are all physical deformities that give some minor advantage and a serious disadvantage, but you may find them useful if they fit your play style or for roleplaying.

* 4 new sleep events. Decreased the probability that the existing negative sleep events will occur.
** Some of the new sleep events are positive, some depend on your choice or luck, some are a mix of good and bad, and some progress in multiple stages.

* The "Item mark adjust" option now allows you to enlarge the item sprite.
** Sprite width and height are also independent settings, allowing you to do more things with images. Beyond a certain size, they may start sticking out of their image frame and interfere with the text displayed, but that shouldn't be a serious issue.

* Dominate spell now paralyzes the target when used by an NPC regardless of whether the target is immune to domination or not.

* Changed the sprites of Mournblade and Storm Bringer so that they resemble the weapons they are referencing a lot more.

* Added some English translations.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some descriptions.

* Fixed the ranch animal trait that yields more corpses not working when Anatomy skill is 0.

* Fixed being able to get quest hints even if the player hadn't reached the prerequisite points in the main quest or was without enough gold to pay the informer despite the message displayed.

* Fixed ZinlaiKyaku special action sometimes freezing the game when it is used some distance away from the player.
** In versions 1.96 and earlier, the freeze can be avoided by setting Effect Speed to 0.

* Fixed being unable to use gauge attacks with 2 recently added unique artifact melee weapons.

* Fixed the baphomet (NB: no English equivalent) evolution's sprite.

* Fixed the tint and English name of Storm Bringer.

* Fixed the hot spring tiles in Melkawn's underground Gamling hall (sic) so that they now reduce insanity.

* Fixed the scripted name change that occurs for Miros and Karura.
** In order to fix any existing issues with their name for saves from a previous version, a fix will be applied when entering Ruoza if their names are longer than they are supposed to be.


==1.96==
'''1/26/2020'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Some main quest content. That's it for the Etherwind arc! All that's left is the final boss battle.

* 1 new unique NPC and unique artifact for the main quest, as well as 1 new equipment attribute.

* 1 new item.

* Revamped the sprites of existing asura monsters.

* Added 5 new asura race NPCs.

* Added 3 new evolutions.

* Some spoken flavour text for the various carbuncle monsters weren't in quotation marks. That has been fixed, and some English translation has also been added. The flavour text should now be exactly the same as the cat NPC's.

* Added Japanese flavour text based on Alice in Wonderland to the various gryffon/gryphon monsters.

* Weakened the effects of Distracted and Melancholy status ailments.
** Melancholy is also no longer applied while Drunk.
** For portraying characters who can't get rid themselves of tobacco dependence because they're always quashing it with booze.

* To prevent the Mages Guild from becoming useless, spellbooks sold by the guild's spell writer are now sold at half price. Spellbooks at the Sacred Library of Irva are now 20x the usual price.

* [In the Japanese version], the terms "wizard" and "mage" were used interchangeably when referring to the guild and NPCs. They are now all called "wizard". This also applies to the Wizard's Harvest spell from vanilla Elona.

* [In the Japanese version], world maps like North Tyris are sometimes referred to as "global map". The in-game help and Norne the guide call it the "world map", so it is now referred to as such. Please let me know if I've missed changing the terminology somewhere.

* Rebalanced upper limit of the cost of hiring an adventurer.
** You can also now choose to hire them for 3, 7, or 30 days.
** Hiring them will also increase their Impress by a small amount. This increase is independent of how long they're hired for.
** The expiry date of their contract is displayed in the lower left corner of the conversation window.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed dipping unblessed items into cursed bottles of dirty water applying the effect but not reducing the number of items in the latter's stack.


==1.95==
'''1/6/2020'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added some main quest content, right up to just before the last floor [of the dungeon].

* You can now buy tips on how to beat the next main quest boss from informers at reasonable prices.
** This is to reduce the number of players who can't seem to find the bosses' weaknesses and end up fighting them and dying again and again, and win only by sheer brute force.
** As for players who don't manage to find this feature or zone out while reading the tips... there's really nothing I can do.
** Might add to the tips or edit them in the future.

* Added 6 new items.

* Added 1 new yith NPC and its evolution.

* You now earn points from your shop. 5x as many points are gained in December.
** Number of points earned depends on number of items sold (including item trades) and the number of customers. If no items have been sold, number of customers won't count.
** Points earned by every shop you own is calculated separately, so it works in favour of players who own multiple shops.
** Use a newly added item to spend your points and exchange them for an item of your choice.

* Big brush and crop management tools are sold in the Embassy in addition to being found in new [farms and ranches].
** Letting players buy new deeds to replace any of the aforementioned items when they lose them seemed acceptable until I remembered that the embassy also sells the shop strongbox, found only in shops.

* Reduced the number of turns needed for fishing to 30%, but greatly increased the amount of in-game time that passes.
** This is to make it feel more laid-back but less cumbersome. It can also be used to pass time if you're waiting for something.

* When using ground bait on a fish placed on top of a water tile, there is now a fish-rank dependent chance of generating a special item.
** It generates at the player's feet, not on top of the fish.
** The chance of this happening differs between each fish rank and is also affected by the rare loot trigger.

* Added additional effects to make placing items in a water tile feel like dipping them in water.

* Reduced the number of materials required to make [a batch of] ground bait by 1.

* The insects that spawn (i.e. weren't placed in the map) in a the basement of a certain house will now have the summoned NPC bit flag.

* Dipping unblessed items into cursed bottles of dirty water caused nothing to happen because they were already unblessed. Now, they will rust or rot.
** This will not happen to food that is not made of raw.
** It was weird that items would rust or rot only if they were blessed.

* The "WIN-Lv" number [on the character sheet] is supposed to be an indicator that your character is able to defeat enemies at that level.
** In order to make it clearer that it's the level of Nefia that you can attempt at the current level, that number is now called "Proper N level".

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some more descriptions.

* Fixed NPCs who are forbidden from items on the ground and are eating an item in their inventory not getting interrupted from their food when displaced by the player.

* Fixed harvesting rods of alchemy from magic crops under the effect of the [crop management tools] yielding scrolls of recharge instead due to a typo in item ID. 

* Fixed card IDs 1,000 and above not displaying in the deck by increasing the range of card IDs displayed.

* Fixed certain graphic settings (e.g. setting Lighting to High) causing issue with fish sprites.

* Chestnuts and dead fish were moving around even though they're not fish, so they no longer share sprites with sea urchins and bomb fish. This will apply to only newly generated [chestnuts and dead fish].


==1.94==
'''11/30/2019'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added a bit more Act III main quest content.

* Added several new tile sprites for Act III.

* Added 1 new unique NPC for the main quest.

* Added 6 new mushroom race NPCs.
** Placed one of those NPCs in a certain Act II sub quest.

* Added 1 new special action, exclusive to NPCs.

* Shift cores still require 100% or more gauge to use, but they no longer consume any gauge when used. This changes their balance quite a bit.

* Tending to crops a different way will cause the type of items harvested from them to somewhat change, allowing the player to have some control over what items to farm.
** Added a new item that increases the +enhance value of harvested items and crop growth speed.
** Decreased the random variation in +enhance value of harvested items.
** The new item does not spawn randomly, and is placed on ground in a new farm.
** It increases the amount of manual labour needed for farming, but allows some choice in what you want to grow and enables some farming roleplay.

* Decreased the selling price of muskmelons and watermelons so that they are just somewhat more expensive than other fruits.

* Increased all types of experience gained from curaria.
** Increased Speed experience gained from stomafillia so that it's now the best herb for training that attribute.
** Increased the spawn chance of the other 4 types of herbs but slightly decreased the amount of experience they give.
** This is to make all types of herbs similar in their usefulness.

* Types of herbs harvested from crops now depend on the season and therefore change every 3 months.

* Type of random artifacts harvested from crops also depend on the season and change every 3 months.
** Speed rings and aurora rings are always harvestable and at a constant chance. The chance of harvesting other artifact types will change as their group goes in and out of season.
** Unknown seeds no longer yield random artifacts.

* Changed the types of rods harvestable from crops as there were too many different types.
** Some types of rods are no longer harvestable as the player already gets those in excess.
** When harvesting a rod, it has a low chance to turn into a rod of wish or rod of domination.

* Made ranches start with a big brush on the ground. You really need only one, so big brushes no longer spawn randomly.

* Made uncooked and non-rotten fish items placed on the ground move randomly around their tile (in water and on dry land).
** Their shadow will not display to prevent inconsistencies with their movement.
** Frequency and behaviour of movement will vary slightly between fish types. Some will jump around while others are barely noticeable.
** They will not move when stacked with other items or if they have a custom sprite.
** This is to make them look a little more alive in their pond and on your chopping block.

* Added 4 new fish types.
** They can be fished up only in Aimwell with any type of bait. These are the only types of fishes obtainable there.

* Decreased the selling price of fish that have never been fed before after obtaining them from fishing.
** Increased the rate at which the selling price of fish increases with the number of times they have been fed.
** Item fusion now crafts 5 ground bait at a time.
** This is to reward effort put into fishing.
** Increased selling price and experience from eating feels a little lacking, so there may be more [reasons to feed fish] to come in the future.

* Removed the level cap for spawned monster balls.
** The constraint that allows monster ball levels to go no higher than the lowest dungeon floor cleared + 10 remains.
** Monster ball sell price increases with level but only up to Lv200.

* Made slight changes to the properties of the doors and map tiles on some maps.

* The conditions for completing a part of the Act III main quest were unclear, causing some people to think that not being able to complete it was a bug, so the descriptions in the journal have been rewritten to be clearer.

* Revamped the descriptions of usable items. They now specify if an item is single-use or reusable.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some descriptions.

* Fixed setting the atmosphere (full-body portrait) for the player causing it to get used in main quest cutscenes.

* Fixed magaice not being excluded from the list of forbidden junk items, causing pets to refuse to take it.


==1.93==
'''10/27/2019'''
 [Changes and additions]
* The option to change the atmosphere (NB: full-body portrait) is now available from the 'i'nteract menu and not from the conversation window.
** With this, every character including the player character and non-pet NPCs can have a full-body portrait assigned to them.
** The full-body portrait is also now displayed when the 'i'nteract menu is open.
** Characters on the left in a tag team will have their portrait displayed on the left, and on on the right for characters on the right.

* Added an underground map to Amur-Cage.
** Talk to <Amurdad> to make the staircase appear.
** This is where the unique NPCs that spawn randomly and the [Fort of] Chaos god NPCs will be placed when they are defeated.
** The random unique NPCs will be here even if they were recruited as pets, and the [Fort of] Chaos NPCs will be here even if they were defeated in the Void or a showroom map.

* Added the spell version of bonus points - spellbonus points. Available only to the player character.
** The bulk of these points are earned when leveling up - the number of points gained depends on Learning attribute and character level. The number of points is unaffected by the Yerles race trait.
** You no longer have to spend skill bonus points on them and don't have to spend as many platinum pieces for magic practice sessions.
** It also allows you to focus on leveling a single spell.
** 5 x player level spellbonus points will be given to save files from a previous version of the game when updating the game.
** When starting a new Purge mode game or upon updating the game with a Purge mode save file from a previous version, 10,000 spellbonus points will be given.

* Main quest section in the journal now has a progress indicator.
** Use it to check if you have triggered events and for reporting bugs.

* 5 new metal race NPCs.

* 1 new special action. Exclusive to NPCs for now.

* 3 new unique artifact weapons.
** 2 of them spawn on certain monsters, 1 of them can be found randomly generated.

* A new item that prevents the holder's cold-element attacks from shattering items.

* And another new item.

* Slightly reduced the damage of Eye of Stiffen and Eye of Illusion but increased the strength of the status ailment they apply.

* Added some code to handle what happens when targeting, interaction, some special actions, and the use of some items is cancelled (e.g. the dialogue for picking a tag partner or a list of option to pick from).
** The aforementioned user inputs can now be cancelled with the cancel key.

* When an NPC uses the Dominate spell or when using that spell on a target that cannot be dominated and the attempt succeeds, the target is now paralysed regardless of resistance to paralysis.
** Unique NPCs and <boss> monsters will be paralysed for 10 turns, and other characters for 30 turns.
** Characters already paralysed and those who have just recovered from paralysis will not be paralysed.

* The arena and pet arena now count number of wins instead of consecutive wins.
** As such, the counter no longer resets upon losing or forfeiting, lowering the bar for attempts.
** To prevent the matches from being a boring grind, however, opponent levels are now increased if their level is a certain amount lower than the number of wins. This applies regardless of whether the player is currently rank 1 in the arena or not.

* Opponents in arena duel matches no longer become boss NPCs at a certain arena rank.
** Removed the bias in monster type selection, and made it possible to know the opponent's level but not the monster name.

* Items rewards for the arena and pet arena every 3, 10, 30, and 50 wins.
** Coin and material rewards stack, but multiples of the same item won't.
** Also changed and rebalanced the 100th win reward for the arena and pet arena. The 100th win reward is now given whether the player is rank 1 in the arena or not.
** All rewards will be placed at your feet upon return to town.

* You can now only challenge the pet arena (includes pet duels and team battles but not EX arena battles) a maximum of 3 times every 24 hours.

* Rebalanced the amount of attribute experience gained by eating herb in food.
** After taking in to account the difference in stats, the amount gained from eating the herbs alone, and the ability to share a meal, the player character and NPCs will earn experience in a 3:5 ratio (previously 1:5). The amount gained by NPCs has not changed.

 [Fixes]
* Inheriting a pet with red spindle of soul spindle now resets the servant/master value reset date to prevent that date from getting assigned a future date.
** Updating the game save to 1.93 will also reset the servant/master value reset date. (They have to be on the same map as you or have to be brought into your party.)

* Elemental damage that is reduced by PV and DV is no longer nullified by characters with the cResEle [elemental immunity] bit flag.

* Fixed <The White Hawk> unique artifact [not reducing long sword gauge attack damage].

* Fixed the issue where paralysis goes away in 1 turn and without displaying any message.

* Fixed the mix-up in the code for <Go-Renge>'s use as a ranged weapon, preventing characters from being able to throw it.

* Fixed eating chewing gum and gum remnant not giving any food effects (like poison, love potion, and herb potential increases) because the game was looking up the new gum remnant product that was in the process of getting generated.


==1.92==
'''9/16/2019'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added a bit more Act III main quest content.

* 2 new NPCs in Act III.

* Added 2 new Throwing-based special actions. They may be difficult to use, but make up for that with their power and area of effect.

* Replaced the Quick Use special action with a new and more watered-down one.

* Changed one of the options that are purchasable with AP. The option to learn Struck Out is now "Tactical Throw". NPCs who have acquired this will be able to use several Throwing-based special actions.

* Accuracy of attacks is now doubled during Continuous attacks special action even if accuracy is negative.

* Removed the additional evasion roll granted by Killing Dance [buff], and replaced it with a buff to Evasion skill.

* Power gauge will now increase by 4% when evading an attack (includes Greater Evasion procs).
** Unlike getting hit, this can increase power gauge by more than once per turn.
** This is to discourage brute-forcing with a large number of attacks, and instead reward increasing accuracy and evasion.

* Added upper and lower caps to the number of moves an NPC can make based on their speed relative to the player character's.
** They can now only move at most 20 times per turn the player makes (even if they have 100 times the player character's Speed), or at least 1 time out of every 20 player turns.
** Shouldn't have much of an effect on normal gameplay.

* The experience multiplier in overdose mode no longer applies when gained experience is negative.

* The slow digestion feat will now work only when satiety drops to Hungry.
** Now it won't get in the way of stat gain.

* When in Purge mode, the player character's hydration level will not decrease beyond a certain value - just like NPCs.
** Starving! and Drying! statuses also won't decrease HP and stamina.

* It will no longer be as dark at night outdoors when a torch is lit.

* Buffed the [additional] damage [received] when [afflicted] by Wince and Chills status ailments from 10% to 20%.

* Wince and Chills status ailments from fire and cold-elemental attacks respectively will now apply and stack like the status ailments for the other elements.
** They also have their own icon bubble now.
** Wince and Chills status ailments from fire and cold-elemental attacks (respectively) can now be blocked by Holy Veil and Regeneration respectively.

* Type of items produced by statues of Kumiromi and Yacatect and the cute fairy no longer depend on the day. They now depend on the total number of times they have produced an item.

* Changed how Little sister corpses give their +1 Life and Mana bonuses.
** The chance to increase Life and Mana used to be random and dependent on the rare loot trigger as well as the current Life and Mana.
** The corpses are now guaranteed to give 1 Mana every 3 corpses [eaten], and 1 Life for every 6 corpses.
** The changes take into account the fact that Cooking skill can produce multiple items from 1 corpse and the difficulty in obtaining magic fruits and hero cheese.

* Player skill experience is now 3 times [what it was in vanilla Elona].
** Pet skill experience remains 4 times the amount [gained by player characters in vanilla Elona].
** This is to address the fact that training the player character was not as efficient as training pets, but there are a lot more ways of gaining skill experience for the player.

* Zaile, West Raskilis valley, and Amur-Cage can now be Returned to.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some descriptions.

* Fixed the issue with the amount of bonus experience gained when the player character defeats an enemy of a lower level.

* Fixed Little sister corpses generated by bio printer giving their effect when eaten - their effect was coded separately from that of other corpses.

* Fixed issue that rat and harpy race characters had with their set of limbs after Icolle deletes a body part.

* Fixed the number of mineral-type materials received not matching up with the number listed in the log when receiving materials from pets.

* Fixed being able to increase Life with AP even when base Life is 300.


==1.91==
'''7/28/2019'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Some more Act III main quest content.

* 1 new Act III map.

* 4 new unique NPCs in Act III.

* 11 new map tiles.

* Using the <Fixity anchor> on a character that already has the Shooting Mode buff will now remove that buff.
** It will also remove any Bind status that was applied by the Fixity anchor.

* Items that spawn less frequently beyond a certain threshold of shop rank and dungeon danger level will now have their rarity increase more slowly, at a rate of 1/10 the value in previous versions. This means that these items will still have a chance to spawn unless shop rank and danger level are about 1000-2000.

* Added the ability to change the minimum skill experience received by [allied characters] in Purge mode.
** This minimum can be set to anywhere from 0.001 to 100 at the Devil Cape.
** Unlike the extra experience received from the Overdose mode multiplier, experience received in this manner is unaffected by potentials and goes directly towards skill levels.

* Increased the chance for the equipment attribute that invokes Shining Wave to proc to that of the equipment attribute that invokes bolt spells.

* The number of hands now gives a percentage increase bonus to critical rate when wielding a two-hand weapon. (No bonus when wielder only has 1 hand; bonus maxes out at 4 hands.) Extra hands are now useful even if they are not equipped with anything.

* Changed the accuracy of Martial Arts attacks so that it is on par with weapon attack accuracy. However, this accuracy now also has a percentage bonus depending on the number of hands. (No bonus when user only has 1 hand; bonus maxes out at 4 hands.) Martial artists do wear protective gear, after all.

* Increased the base damage dice for Martial Arts and also the rate at which the dice increase with skill level.
** It would be too broken if the dice increase up to skill level 2000, so they cap out at skill level 550. All in all, the damage cap is lower but is reached more easily.

* Increased base armour pierce for Martial Arts from 5% to 15%. Decreased the rate at which armour pierce increases with Martial Arts skill level.
** The cap of 50% armour pierce remains the same.
** This and the previous changes should make Martial Arts viable right from early game, and also stronger throughout the game until the damage cap is reached.

* Armour pierce of weapons will now also increase with weapon skill levels - though at a lower rate than armour pierce from Martial Arts skill.
** Armour pierce of weapon skills that have a lower base armour pierce will increase more quickly with skill levels.
** This is so that low pierce weapons don't become irrelevant in late game where the difference in damage dice between weapon types is diminished.

* Defeating an enemy with a higher Speed attribute will now award a small amount of Speed experience.
** This is also awarded to the tag partner if applicable, and to the player if it was a summoned undead that defeated the enemy.
** To make it harder to have a higher Speed attribute than enemies in the current act of the main quest that the player is in, this does not apply in the Void, nor does it apply to monsters that were summoned or split.

* Food no longer give Speed experience depending on their +enhance value.
** Instead, they will give Speed potential depending on the +enhance value.
** This Speed potential is given to both the player character and the pet when sharing a meal.

* Slightly increased the amount of +enhance value-dependent potential that picnic baskets give to make up for the effort required to create them.

* Doubled the amount of potential that is gained due to character class when sleeping.

* Changed the [Japanese] descriptions of special actions so that they now say "regular attack" instead of "physical attack".
** This is to make a distinction between special actions that execute regular attacks and those that are a completely different type of attack.

* Changed some other descriptions.

 [Fixes]
* Items can no longer be thrown onto a tile that has a closed door, board, town board, or voting box.
** Thrown items that miss their target tile will also not land on tiles with the aforementioned objects.

* Fixed equip update not properly changing war hammers into clubs.


==1.90==
'''6/17/2019'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Reverted the default BGM in Your Home to the vanilla Elona piece [PSML516] because the composer has put it up for distribution again.
** The very excellent piece used until now [machi04] is now set to the default BGM in the storage, shelter, and discarded ranch in order to keep its presence in the game.
** Both of these changes will not affect existing saves unless you change the BGM or construct a new deed.

* Added unique artifacts for the weapon types that don't have one yet: kunai, fleure, drill, tomahawk, scissors, shakujo, nunchaku, crossfire, sox, ballista, rock, repeating bow, and short bow.
** These will all spawn at random, but in future versions they may get dropped by certain monsters instead.

* Added 1 new equipment attribute.

* Added 7 new orc race NPCs.

* Added 2 new evolutions.

* Rebalanced the amount of Negotiation experience gained from buying and selling.
** Greatly increased the amount gained at every Negotiation level, but decreased the amount gained per transaction.

* Defeating an enemy with one of the Negotiation special actions will now give regular character experience as well as an enemy level-dependent amount of Negotiation experience.

* When the player character defeats an enemy of a lower character level, it now gives at least 10 experience even if the initial calculation rounds down to 0.

* Added text to hint to what will happen if you stay behind and help Icolle with his experiments after his sub quest.
** Also, if the game fails to lookup the race of a character because the game save is from a later version or something, that character will be given a set of human body parts.

* Mixing a bottle of dirty water or other similar items with a blessed item will now remove that item's blessed status.
** Regular dirty water will un-bless one item, and blessed dirty water will un-bless the entire stack.
** Mixing cursed dirty water will also cause the target item to corrode or rot.

* Added 2 new materials - bamboo and nanomachine.

* Wooden items now generate naturally.
** Newly-generated wooden items will now have the equipment attributes intrinsic to wood.

* Lead material now has its own intrinsic equipment attribute as well.

* Regular attacks of repeating bow, machine gun, gun pair, and shot gun now have new animations.

* The sprites of certain items like scythes, axes, shields, shurikens, and panties, and also items thrown with Spinning Throw will now spin on their way to the target.

* Short bows now have their own sprite. They no longer look identical to long bows.

* <Astral Sickle> is now a bone scythe. Changed its damage dice.

* The kneaded sweets of witch item will now cause only 5 turns of Unconsciousness (i.e. half its usual number of turns) when used on a unique NPC.

* Nerfed the duration of the Killing Dance buff.

* Charge Attack special action no longer asks the player to press a key before beginning, and will instead have a short Waiting period.
** There will be no Wait if the user is out of sight, or if Effect Speed has been set to 0.
** The visual effect for when the charge completes is also not played if the user is out of sight.

* Changed the effect of the Touch of Hunger special action.
** It now applies a debuff that doubles the loss of satiation and hydration per turn.

* Added English translations to some text files.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some descriptions.

* Fixed the width of the status displays in the English version so that it doesn't get cut off.

* Fixed the hot spring tiles in Ludus so that they reduce insanity.

* NPCs in Defense mode will now properly end their turn when they don't use Disturbance in combat.

* Fixed the crash that occurred when sacrificing ranch animals that have their Impress above a certain value to god.

* Fixed some Nefia race spawning conditions not matching what is described in the detailed changelog.

* Fixed enquiring Melget about adventurers' items causing those items to get removed.
** Instead of picking items at random from the target adventurer's inventory, it will now return items ordered by item id.

* Fixed using a pet staying at your home as a donor in gene engineering causing that pet to resurrect under certain conditions.


==1.89==
'''4/20/2019'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Increased the amount of experience player characters get from eating food so that they get the same amount as NPCs (i.e. it is now 5x what it was in previous versions).
** This adjustment was made after considering the cost of increasing potentials and the difference in experience gained for doing things. After all, if there's too much of an attribute gap between [pets] and player characters, it would make more sense to leave all the fighting to them.

* Added 1 new item and its item fusion recipe.

* Added 4 more options to register-type items on the ranch.

* Increased the number of produce generated on the ranch per day, and decreased the limit on maximum amount of produce so that ranches can only accumulate up to 30 days' worth of produce.
** This makes it worth checking in once a month instead of just letting it run even if you don't micromanage the ranch animals.
** With this, benefits of the ranch are reduced when fast-forwarding time, and it won't be exploding with produce when skipping 3 years into the future.

* NPC sprites will now shrink when they are given cursed milk, up to a maximum of 5 times. (Won't work with animated sprites.)
** They will appear normal-sized on their character sheet and in the conversation window.
** When given milk while their satiety is below a certain threshold, their sprite size will recover from shrinkage by 1 size. Blessed milk recovers it by 2 sizes.
** Sprites will not increase beyond their original size.
** Ranch animals will have their master/servant relationship and Impress increased when their size increases, and decreased when they shrink.
** Alchemical Rain will no longer work with milk. 

* Newborn ranch animals are now 0 years old when generated, even for NPCs like old person.
** Their sprite will also start out shrunken by 5 sizes. This has no effect on their weight and height stats [on their character sheet].
** Existing ranch animals from a previous version's save file will be shrunken by 5 sizes when the player character enters the ranch after updating the game.
** Shrunken ranch animals cannot be milked by Squeezing them. There is no difference in their rate of egg and milk generation [when compared to adult ranch animals] though.

* Throwing milk at ranch animals is no longer considered an attack on them.

* Satiety of ranch animals will now decrease when generating animal produce. Their satiety will not decrease below a certain value.

* The +enhance value of ranch animal corpse, skin, and milk (from Squeezing) now has a new +0 to +5 modifier dependent on their sprite size. This is on top of the existing modifier for how much they were Rubbed.
** Decreased the random variation in +enhance value of animal produce to less than half of what it was in previous versions.

* The conversation window will now have the NPC's current size. Will display only for those with a shrunken sprite.

* You can now talk to ranch animals - they no longer ignore you. The conversation window for them will now also display servant-master relationship and anniversary date.

* Live ranch animals can now be offered to god via a conversation window option.
** Favour increase is dependent on meat quality, and Faith skill experience awarded is dependent on Impress. Animal weight has no effect, meaning that light animals are no longer less useful for increasing favour.
** Does not increase prayer charge.

* Ranch animals can now be taught tricks via the conversation window using any item of your choice and with some Attract.
** Gives a slight amount of Perception experience for both the player character and the ranch animal, and increases servant-master relationship.
** Also useful for getting rid of unwanted items.

* Rubbing ranch animals will now increase their Impress. Impress will increase even when corpse quality has been maxed out.
** Also removed the wait while Rubbing to make things go faster.

* The breeder on a ranch can now be Rubbed - even if they were already recently Rubbed.
** Animals that have been Rubbed will now sparkle until they are ready to be brushed again.
** The higher their meat quality, the brighter the sparkling.

* Rebalanced the selling price and weight of corpses and eggs so that the amount they fetch is roughly in a 5:1 ratio.
** Just so that culling ranch animals for their meat is still a viable option.
** Also reduced the variation in selling price due to weight.
** Lighter corpses will now fetch a decent price, and heavy eggs will no longer have an anomalously high selling price.

* Rebalanced the weight of shit and monster parts to a roughly 3:1 ratio. Both are now lighter.
** Reduced the variation in price due to weight for shit.

* Pets sold to slave masters will now fetch a higher price depending on their servant/master relationship and Impress.

* Every ranch animal now has a 0.01% of getting a low-strength Sick status whenever the ranch is refreshed.
** This chance increases by 1% for every shit left on the map, and 5% for every sick ranch animal.
** They won't get Sick if they are under the effect of a previous disinfect, so disinfecting the ranch is important. That said, just keeping the ranch clean is enough to completely prevent the animals from getting Sick.
** When the animals are Sick, they will become Poisoned and produce a lot more shit.
** If you can't cure their Sickness, you may want to cull them or take them out for quarantine.

* Updated the ranch manual.

* Corpses obtained on a certain map in Act III will no longer have any special effects when eaten [like gaining resistances]. Human flesh will still behave as such though.

* Bio printers will now yield corpses as well. Their price is fixed, however, and will have no special effects when eaten. Human flesh will still behave as such.
** Greatly reduced the weight of bio printers.

* The distance multiplier for throwing kunai is now the same as that for tomahawk.
** Changed the intrinsic equipment attribute of kunai to improve your Stealth, Mining, Detection, and Carpentry.
** The equipment attribute strength displays as # but the actual value is 1/4 those of other weapons.

* High potion of soma now heals all status ailments and completely cures Sickness as well.
** High potion of nektar now completely cures anorexia. Made a slight change to the description.
** Nektar now resets the number of times vomited so that you can't vomit while drunk and get anorexic again.

* Mimic-type monsters no longer have their power gauge, emoticon, and shadow beneath them displayed.
** Those will be displayed only for mimic pets.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed pets automatically switching themselves to Talking mode instead of Onslaught in the pet arena. Pets who were already set to Talking mode will remain in it.

* Fixed not being able to make snow mans from handfuls of snow.

* Fixed the hot spring tiles in The smoke and pipe so that they reduce insanity.

* Fixed lizardman NPCs spawning in Cemetery-type instead of Fort-type random Nefia.

* Fixed the log glitching up when a piece of equipment of lower than Miracle quality procs interlocking shooting mechanism or proximity assist weapon.

* Bio battery will now also prevent cursed potions of slow from changing weight.


==1.88R==
'''3/18/2019'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added 5 wide-area special actions that will resolve conflicts with speech.
** The Negotiator feats will now grant these instead.
** Makes roleplaying as a character who resolves problems peacefully via conversation, jokes, and song possible.
** Flavour text displayed when used can be customized by altering %txtBtalk.
** A completely pacifist playthrough will be difficult, so you may have to pick your enemies carefully or just settle for playing support [for your pets].

* Added Talking mode to Directive and command flag.
** Like in Intercept mode, NPCs in Negotiation mode will try to remain within your range of sight.
** Out of the aforementioned Negotiator wide-area special actions, they will repeatedly use the one that they have the highest attribute for.
** For creating support characters and non-combat personnel pets.

* Collected Power special action now also recovers 5% SP.

* Added 4 new items.

* Added 15 new weapons types.
** Gauge attacks will work with these, but the ability to craft them and use equip update on them has yet to be implemented.
** Added 2 more rows to item.bmp for their sprites and for future content.

* Changed the description of some existing weapon types.

* [Reduced] the spawn rate and selling price of some existing weapon types. Weapons that were generated in previous versions of the game will not be affected.

* Changed the <Beast Sickle>'s sprite. Does not affect copies of the artifact that were generated in previous versions of the game.

* <Frisia's Tail> is now a stave instead of a scythe. Does not affect copies of the artifact that were generated in previous versions of the game.
** It procs Decapitation, but it looks like a staff and the description also says it's one. Just so that it's not too similar to the Beast Sickle.

* Buffed the distance modifier for all throwing weapons except for <Nightmare> to 09-10-08-07.

* Added 1 new item fusion recipe.

* Kills by non-pet NPCs no longer contribute to the kill counter.

* Damage dealt by juice made with Hazard Recipe will now be considered an attack by the player even if the NPC drinks it of his own volition.

* Deaths by Psychic Wave, getting gouged out by chestnuts, and getting hit by the hard edge of a block of tofu are now considered kills, not accidents. They will now award AP accordingly just like other kills.

* When chestnuts hit a target, they will now deal a random amount of Throwing skill-dependent non-elemental damage before dealing cut-element damage.
** Reduced the cut-element damage dealt by about half.

* The accuracy multiplier is now 2x regardless of distance for characters buffed by Shooting Mode.

* The power gauge is now displayed albeit greyed out for NPCs who are unable to use gauge attacks.

* NPCs who use Pressure special action in their default combat mode and NPCs who use Disturbance when in Defense mode will no longer waste it on enemies who can't use gauge attacks.

* Added some alternative texts to objet of heart and made them usable on non-pet NPCs. For determining the weak point of enemies and such.

* Equipment that weighs less than 0.1s can now be lightened at the blacksmith.
** If the resulting weight is less than 0.01s, it will be rounded off to 0.01s. (It will display as 0.0s.)
** This is because the critical chance multiplier for weapon and ammo lightness maxes out at 0.01s.

* Inn shops now have a low chance of stocking coffee, cola, mugi tea, green tea, black tea, and juice.

* Choosing to decrease stats at the Oblivion Palace will no longer decrease the selected character's level.

* When entering a map after updating the game from a previous version [to this version], all constructed shelters on all maps will be deconstructed. This will happen only once.
** Apparently there are people who leave toilets in shelters, so one toilet will be provided when updating the game.

* Players can now choose to continue playing when dead in Purge mode. Use of this feature is completely optional.
** The number of remaining lives you get can be changed at the Devil Cape. The choices available are 0 (default), 3, 9, 20, and 99 lives.
** When dying with at least 1 remaining life, the player character will revive on the spot and recover from all status ailments.
** In addition to that, the player character will also become invulnerable for 3 turns. This should be enough for the player character to pull himself together and continue the fight, as long as there isn't too much of a power difference.
** Number of remaining lives is displayed on the character sheet beside the portrait.
** Changing the [maximum] number of remaining lives will set the number of remaining lives to that number, no matter how many remaining lives there were.
** For players who don't want to be kept on their toes by accidental deaths and are fine with zombie-attacking enemies.

* Lowered the default experience multiplier for overdose mode to 3x. This is adjustable at the Devil Cape. Pick from a list that ranges from a modest value to an extreme one - 3x, 5x, 10x, 20x, and 30x.

* Set potential decreases in overdose and purge modes to a fixed -5%, i.e. independent of current potential. Now you can level up even faster. Yay.

 [Fixes]
* None.


==1.88==
'''3/18/2019'''
NB: Above changelog for 1.88R was the same as this version.


==1.87==
'''11/2/2019'''
 [Changes and additions]
* 1 new location for Act III.
* 41 new map tiles.
* 3 new unique NPCs for Act III.
* Added a repeatable hunting side-quest, available from black gauntlet <Leold>.
** The difficulty will increase in very small increments for you to push your limits, try out different tactics, and get measurably better at the game.
** Summoned monsters will also count towards the quota, so you can actually grind out the quest beside him.
* Added a "highest enemy level defeated" to pets' character sheet. It's like the deepest dungeon floor cleared stat, but separate for each of your pets.
** For use as a reference in determining how strong your pets are.
* 1 new unique artifact available for exchange with music tickets.
* When sleeping without a bed, spell potential recovery will be postponed to the next time the player character sleeps in a bed instead of losing out on it.
** It can be postponed up to 9 times, and sleeping in a bed will recover all of the spell potential accrued at once.
* Added 1 new special action.
* Thread of Innervation special action will now give Gene engineer skill experience when used.
* NPCs that use the Pressure special action will no longer use it when their MP is 0 or lower.
* Changed the player's spawning location when entering Zaile from the top or right.
* Buffed the attribute experience from the various forms of tobacco items so that they give 1.5 times as much as rare herbs like morgia.
** At +15 enhance, they will train 3 times as much as the rare herbs.
** This is to balance out the fact that "herb in" food from item fusion trains 9 attributes at a go, while tobacco products have a drawback even though you can make 4 at a time.
* Removed sleepiness reduction from coffee and tobacco products.
** Made them prevent the player character from taking a nap on the world map a certain number of times instead (15 to 25 for coffee, 3 to 5 for tobacco).
** The nap-preventing counter has no effect on regular sleep whatsoever, and will be set to 0 when waking up.
* Changed the mechanic where NPCs had their power gauge increased by 15% if they did nothing during their turn while in combat.
** Enemy and friendly NPCs will now have their power gauge increased only if their target is in their sight.
** This means that they will no longer build up their power gauge out of your sight before engaging you.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some code for resetting shopkeeper feats.
* Using an encount canceller as a 't'ool will no longer pour it onto you like for other potions.
* Added measures to prevent the player character's coordinates from becoming incorrect when spawning on top of certain tiles in tile group 3.


==1.86==
'''1/5/2019'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added more than 100 new map tiles as part of recreating [Etherwind's] content and maps. Placeholder tiles in Zaile have been replaced. (For save files from previous versions, the change will be applied the next time the map gets refreshed.)
* Added a new feature to house boards and [registers] that allows you to "Change tile group" for your properties.
** With this, you can make your properties look like the world map or mansion of younger sister.
** The selection of tiles available in design mode has also been changed.
** Hot springs can now be placed, but they will now only have an effect in Larna and Arcbelc.
* Added a new item that lets you move your constructed deeds to another tile with their interior intact. With a bit of effort, they can also move properties to another continent. These can be bought at places like the embassy for cheap.
* Danger level of shelter maps, which depends on their serial number, will now loop from 5 to 50. This affects existing shelter maps. When the danger level loops, the newly constructed shelter map will get reset [as well as any other shelter map that shares that danger level]. This means that you can have up to 46 different shelters, but upon exceeding that by constructing and removing more shelters, their contents will start disappearing.
* Added the option to remove all shopkeeper feats from a character. Available at a certain character in South Tyris. Sales exp doesn't get reset, so feats can be re-learned easily.
* Added the option to remove all equipment attributes and Exp from a living weapon. Available at a certain character in South Tyris.
** If that weapon has any +enhance value that is 1 or greater, that value is also reset to 0.
** Acidproofing and fireproofing are not equipment attributes, so those will not get removed.
** Be careful, because ALL equipment attributes will get removed, including those that were generated based on your luck, those inherent to the weapon type, and those inherent to the weapon's material.
* When interacting with your player character while riding, you can now choose between interacting with the player character or with the steed. You no longer have to get off and get on your horse to do things.
* Changed the damage calculation for Unison Impact special action.
** It no longer adds the skill levels for your entire party then uses the sum to calculate damage.
** Instead, it calculates the damage for every individual member, then sums that damage and applies it.
** This reduces the difference in amount of damage you can deal with Unison Impact and with Gauge Release attacks at maximum power gauge for all members.
* Quaffing juice made from food modified by the Hazard Recipe will now deal mind damage dependent on the player's Gene engineer skill level.
** Unlike eating (Danger!) food, juice made this way will also retain their original effects [such as giving attribute experience]. One special blend, coming right up!
* Made it possible to use potions as a 't'ool aside from 'q'uaffing them. This will throw the potion on yourself, skipping the need to target the tile you are standing on. This is for when you want to increase your hydration level by just a bit.
* Added potion of weakness to type II potion throwing.
* Implemented a maximum and minimum cap on the amount of time passed per turn.
* Made it possible to use items set as no-drop as an item mark.
* Doubled the player character's resistance to brainwashing.
* Increased the resistance to insanity conferred by drunk status and the unique NPC bonuses.
* Made dark fragments awarded from town board quests generate unblessed and uncursed.
* The gum remnant generated after eating chewing gum or gum remnant will now go directly into a character's inventory if there is sufficient space in it.
* NPCs will no longer eat food thrown at them when they are asleep or unconscious.
* Made audience members with the escort bit flag in an Act III sub quest immune to domination. Enemies in this sub quest can still be dominated.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some descriptions.
* Fixed the crash that occurred when selecting the item mark option in the English version.
* Fixed the Tag Force buff's brainwash resistance not working for the player.
* Fixed the pet arena counter not getting reset after every match, causing it to keep counting until a loss or until [the player] moves a step.
* Fixed the crash from vanilla Elona that occurred when the game window is set to 1152 x 864, the cursor is placed on the top right corner of the window in Design mode, and then the left cursor key is pressed to cause the view to scroll to the side.
* Fixed the AP cost for increasing life not getting calculated properly sometimes.
* Fixed characters buffed by Concentration not being immune to confusion.
* Fixed freshness and value of items not getting set properly sometimes when stacking items with the 'I' key.


==1.85==
'''12/5/2018'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added "Item mark set/adjust/move/delete" to the 'i'nteract menu for characters.
** Select an item from your inventory to place a smaller version of that item's sprite at the lower left corner of that character's sprite (except when on the world map).
** It supports item hue and items that have had their sprites customized via Garokk. It will also work on the player character [if you 'i'nteract with yourself].
** You can customize their position, size, and rotation to an extent, as well as whether they appear in front or behind that character.
** Simplicity was a priority, so if you want to have multiple sprites or flip the image or something you'll have to create your own sprites.
** You can use this to remember which pet is holding which item or to differentiate between pets that look really similar, or just as decoration.
* Combined weapon and armor hardening at the blacksmith into equipment hardening.
** Also added new options to make equipment lighter or heavier. (Works only for >0.1s and <100s items respectively.)
** The weight modifications are expensive and are also not subject to the Fighters Guild's 50% discount.
** This lets you fine-tune item weights in 0.1s increments/decrements, which was not possible with flying scrolls that added or subtracted a percentage of item weight.
* Added an event dialogue that happens on anniversaries. It triggers when waking up on the day of an anniversary for a pet who is at Fellow or above, and one or more year has passed since that anniversary. Will happen for only one pet's anniversary [every time you wake up]. If you don't wake up on anniversary day, it won't trigger.
* Added 2 new special actions, both of which can be learned by the player.
* Added 6 new kobolt and 1 new bacteria NPCs.
* Added 1 new evolution.
* Added 1 new item.
* Implemented 2 item fusion recipes.
* Set the upper limit of the quota for trap removal quests to 200. There are at least 325 traps on the map, so getting 1.5 times the quota is still possible.
* The mine version of trap removal quests will now generate only above 15,000 fame and will now give 1 bronze coin even if you don't reach 1.5 times the quota.
* Danger level of shelter maps no longer go up as their No increase. This is to curtail their abuse for danger level-dependent things and the need for repeatedly constructing and removing shelters.
* Summoned NPCs will now have the summoned bit flag even if they are neither hostile nor spirits. Non-hostile NPCs with the summoned bit flag will not despawn from the map upon reentering the map after some time.
* Buffed the effect of MP recovery on MPoison. It now halves MPoison strength then subtracts 10, instead of only subtracting 10. This means that pets who can't use rods will be fine with just a few scrolls of mana in their inventory.
* Removed the auto-save from drinking blessed potions of potential because potentials increased are not random.
* Added wait to the auto-save when encountering assassins during an escort quest. Prevented user input for movement from registering before the wait comes into effect.
* Decreased the regular damage part of decapitation and also made it reduced by the target's PV.
* Made necromancy undead immune to Group Hypnosis (like they are to Eye of brainwashing) including its sleep effect.
* Prevented poisoned food items from getting used in "Let's have a meal together.".

 [Fixes]
* Fixed Tag Force that was supposed to be used by <Rianna> the daydreamer getting used by zanan old soldier instead.
* Fixed Killing Dance special action sometimes buffing the user's target instead of the user himself.
* Fixed not receiving skill experience for disarming pitfalls on quest maps.
* Fixed disarming traps by standing on top of them and pressing the enter key not counting towards the quest quota. Manually disarming them while floating is safer but remember that it takes twice as many turns.
* Fixed some food items turning invisible on the ground instead of getting destroyed after being thrown.
* Fixed some cases in which pet names don't change after evolution.
* Fixed happy apples not being in the list of items available for purchase with music tickets.

==1.84==
'''10/28/2018'''
 [Changes and additions]
* The new Act III area is now called Aimwell as per [Noa's Etherwind] to prevent confusion. Changed some text to reflect this change.
* Added 4 new evolutions.
* Added 1 new NPC.
* Added 8 new items.
* Added 1 new special action.
* Group Hypnosis special action now has an additional roll which will inflict low strength Nightmare if it succeeds. This roll is independent of the first roll that determines whether the target is put to sleep or not.
* Decapitation special action was basically a wasted turn if the target was not at low health, so it will now deal a small amount of Dexterity-dependent damage before rolling to decapitate the target.
** If target HP is not low enough for Decapitation to proc and target is afflicted by less than 10 turns of Dyspnea, it will now also inflict 3 turns of Dyspnea.
** [These changes only affect the special action.] Other special actions that have a chance of decapitating their target and the equipment attribute remain the same.
* Characters afflicted by Gravity status ailment can no longer evade traps. Trap disarming is still possible as the roll to disarm occurs before trap evasion.
* Added pitfall traps to Nefia.
** Characters that are not floating will be dealt danger level-dependent damage (reduced by DV) when they get caught in it. 2 turns of Invert status ailment is them applied to them if they are currently afflicted by less than 2 turns of Invert. The pitfall trap disappears after it triggers.
* Pitfall traps can now be created by 'D'igging at your feet (except on the world map). Disarming pitfalls you created yield no experience.
* New town board quest for defusing traps. There are variations of it that require filling in pitfalls and defusing land mines.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed length getting inappropriately appended to some item names.
* Fixed race spawning rules for Nefia getting ignored for extremely low danger levels, causing NPCs that are around level 10 to spawn.
* Fixed hiring an adventurer, taking on an escort quest, getting caught by assassins, [saving the game], then loading it undoing the adventurer's placement on the map and crashing the game during the adventurer's turn. When updating the game from a previous version, the game will attempt to place [hired] adventurers somewhere on the current map during the first turn.
* The unique NPC modifier no longer shortens the countdown for Death Word for pets.
* Fixed hunting quests not getting cleared if the target monster's time has been stopped, and rendering the quest impossible to clear if the player exits the map while time is stopped. Time now will automatically start to run again after all targets have been defeated.


==1.83==
'''9/24/2018'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added 4 new types of random Nefia.
* Made the types of monsters that spawn within random Nefia dependent on their type. Human, metal, god-types and random unique NPCs can spawn in every type.
* Life attribute can now be raised with AP. 10 Life costs base Life x 2 + 300 AP. It costs an additional 300 AP for characters with the cArmour bit flag, and an additional 800 AP for cMetal. It cannot be raised when base Life is 300 or greater.
* Added 6 new bird NPCs.
* Added another 2 new NPCs.
* Added 4 new items.
* Added 1 new item fusion recipe.
* Most food items no longer disappear when thrown if they don't get eaten by the target. This holds true even if they miss their target. Tofu and soybean, which are primarily attack items, are now reusable. Natto, butter, and yoghurt are exceptions, and will disappear when thrown.
* Breakfast event will now recover hydration.
* Instead of activating when the player's HP is less than half, Tactical Heal's Healing Rain will now activate when any character in the player's party has less than half HP left.
* Characters other than the player will no longer change their target for 3 turns when Provoked, even if they get attacked. Unless, of course, that target is no longer on the map.
* Pets no longer eat off the ground during Party Time!.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some descriptions.
* Fixed throwing a stack of food items reducing that stack by 2.
* Fixed the crash that occurred when attempting to draw an undead that has been remodeled with <Part time worker> the red sword's figure.
* Fixed purge mode not actually having a 1% minimum for all potentials.


==1.82==
'''8/26/2018'''
 [Changes and Additions]
* Added 1 new map for Act III.
* Added 1 new Act III sub quest.
* Added 4 new NPCs.
* Managed to get permission, so restored the art on the ground of the mansion of younger sister.
* Added 3 new special actions. 1 of them can be learned by the player.
* Using Resolution Hand will now give a small amount of Alchemy experience.
** When using it after Touch of Sleep, there is now another chance to put the target to sleep after applying the additional damage from this move.
** When using it after Touch of Weakness on a unique NPC, the additional damage will now get applied instead of getting negated.
* Made it possible to throw all food items.
** When food items that don't have special effects are thrown and hit hungry characters, they will get eaten within that turn.
** When this happens, there is a chance that 10 turns of Dyspnea will be applied to that character. When throwing mochi at characters other than the player character, this effect will take precedence over the chance of applying Choked.
** If the food item hits a character who isn't hungry, it will deal weight-dependent damage.
** Like natto, food items thrown will disappear whether they hit their target or not. Chestnuts are the only exception to this rule.
** This feature can be used to feed NPCs cursed or poisoned food, or to shove food down the throats of pets who are slow to eat.
** Or you could pretend to be a certain plumber and defeat enemies by throwing turtles and vegetables at them.
** You can also change the sex of non-pet NPCs by throwing forbidden meat at them.
* Added Dyspnea status ailment as a milder version of Choked. Made the status ailment display for the Japanese version slightly wider to accommodate the longer name.
** Dyspnea will not disable actions, but the character will stagger while moving and also take damage over time.
** Choked will now disable all actions and also do damage over time.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed the (Need sleep) item attribute.
* Fixed Choked status ailment not going away even when the status ailment's strength has decreased naturally with time to the point that the character is able to breathe.


==1.81==
'''7/29/2018'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added 6 new Act III NPCs. They spawn only in the wilderness of the new world map.
* Doubled the [number] of potions that can be quaffed before reaching the satiety limit and vomiting.
* Items with a cooldown of 24 hours and longer will now require the player to sleep at least once before they can be reused.
** Also, [items] that require the player to sleep once before they can be used again after visiting the Deep-sea castle will now display (Need Sleep) in their name.
* Decreased the base power and SP cost of Violent Garden.
* Increased the base size of goldfish, as the smaller ones were weighing 0.0s and had a size of 0cm.
* Added a new door sprite - a single door. They are available as an option on the house board's "Change door type".

 [Fixes]
* Fixed the code for extending the expiry date of fish on water tiles not being able to handle fish in the player's inventory, causing a crash. A couple of ways to avoid this in 1.80 is to put fish in the 4-dimensional pocket, cook them, or let them rot.
* Fixed not obtaining the lump sum of money, bonus skill points, and special actions when switching the game mode to purge.
** Updating the game will award these bonuses to all existing purge mode save files - this applies to games that were purge mode to begin with and those that were switched to purge mode during gameplay.
* Fixed [astral light pen copies of] a certain unique NPC getting rendered unconscious by a story event every turn.


==1.80==
'''7/16/2018'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Made slight changes to the sprites of some NPCs.
* Made it possible to irreversibly switch the game mode of an existing save to an easier one. Added a new map and new unique NPC to southern edge of North Tyris.
* Added 1 new item. Added the item fusion recipe to make it.
* Made strength of Choked status ailment [have a chance of] decreasing every turn.
** When it reaches 0 or below and the character is still alive, then the status ailment is cured.
** NPCs will bash only if the strength of Choke is above a certain threshold. Decreased base damage for bash.
** Characters will now take Choke damage only if the strength of Choke is above a certain threshold. The damage is no longer a fixed value, and is now Constitution-dependent.
** Groundwork for a Choke attack.
* When getting doused in a potion or stepping into a puddle made by one, it now increases satiety and hydration by only 1/5 of the original values. This should be useful in some situations.
* Decreased the amount of hydration gained from drinking water sources like fountains. The hydration gain is now the same as that for potions.
* Hydration now decreases to the point where there is no status indicator when producing urine, no matter how high the hydration was before that.
* Added an option in the settings to turn off waste matter generation.
** NB: "Block dust generation".
** When off, it stops the generation of vomit when vomiting, ranch animals no longer produce shit, and urine is no longer produced when Marking is used or a character wets himself.
** This is for people who found it too gross even as a game.
** It does not turn off their random generation, so guards will still want other people's shit by fair means or foul sometimes.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed the crash that sometimes occurred when leaving the current map.
* Fixed the shop's item sale limit and the experience bonus earned by setting the limit not working when the player character is not in the shop.
* Fixed not being able to use the Resurrection spell on the dead even after changing maps.
* Fixed the sound effect for attacking getting played for slip damage like poison and bleed when the options under Attack Animation have been turned on.


==1.79==
'''7/7/2018'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added some descriptions.
* Added 1 new red book. Not randomly generated. Placed in Melugas when it gets refreshed.
* HP regeneration ticks are now more frequent when Satisfied and above. SP regeneration ticks are also more frequent when Wetting or above.
* Urine is no longer randomly generated.
* There is no longer a sound effect for becoming Drying! dehydrated as players cannot die from dehydration.
* When Wet and hydration level is low, hydration will now slowly recover until it reaches the point where no hydration status is displayed. Doubled the amount of leeway between Distended and going over hydration limit.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed mix-up in variables for cooldown time for changing shop type and the limit on the number of items [the shop can sell], which was causing things like Negotiation experience overflow and other unintended behaviour. To prevent further errors from occurring, the cooldown time and item limit will be reset when updating the game.
* Fixed the graphical glitch that occurred when using ground bait that is placed on the ground. Also changed the message displayed when splitting fish from their original item stack and placing them in a new one when they are fed ground bait.
* Fixed the item sprite for flesh doll not displaying properly.
* Fixed NPCs with prostitute AIs playing a sound effect whenever they latch onto a target. That's a piece of code that was used for debugging.


==1.78==
'''6/30/2018'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added a new world map. There are no enemy encounters, wandering vendors, or random Nefia here. To be honest, there's really nothing much to do here for now. In future versions, there will be monsters in the wilderness here that can be found nowhere else.
* Temporarily added a new map. The tile sprites you see here are make-shift. Conversations with the NPCs here not yet scripted. Added 2 new trade goods [available] only here.
* Added 7 new NPCs for Act III. Conversations and other stuff to come later.
* Expanded character.bmp by 3 [more rows] to make room for future updates, so do be careful if you've replaced the entire sprite sheet with a custom one.
* Removed the art on the ground at mansion of younger sister due to copyright concerns. It will eventually get replaced.
* Increased the 100-consecutive win bonus for the arena and pet arena. This bonus, however, will now be awarded only at rank 1.
* You can now limit the the number of items sold by your shop per day to 15 or 5. The lower the item limit, the higher the bonus Negotiation experience earned by the shopkeeper. You can use this if you don't want to have to restock your shop as often.
* You can no longer change the shop type for 15 days after a change.
* Added thirst mechanic, the quaffing version of hunger. Hydration increases when drinking fluids and decreases when vomiting.
** The status display will go from Drying!, Drying, Thirsty, (no description), Wetting, and Distended.
** NB: alternative translation - Dehydrated, Parched, Thirsty, (no description), Hydrated, and Overhydrated.
** Hydration decreases naturally at a slower rate than satiety and stops decreasing when Wet.
** Being in the desert in the daytime will also cause it to decrease - this decrease stacks with the aforementioned natural decrease. For NPCs, the natural decrease stops at a hydration value that is just before Thirsty.
** This is another parameter that the player will have to manage. That said, all that Drying! will do is cause stamina to decrease when not Wet; characters will never die of it.
** Quaffing potions will not be possible when Wetting or above, but you can still douse yourself with them.
** A puddle will be generated at that character's feet and hydration will be decreased when a character is Wetting or Distended and gets hit by Body Blow, or is Distended and is inflicted with Fear. This may also happen at random when increasing hydration beyond Wetting.
** Also added a new item for [making] puddles and a special action for decreasing hydration.
* Added an option to the conversation with bartenders - the drink version of the Innkeeper's "Bring me something to eat."
** Hydration will become Distended, and satiety will slightly increase.
** The time has come for bartenders to act like bartenders.
* In Purge mode: made it possible to eat even when Satisfied and above, and to drink even when Distended. The character will throw up or wet himself though.
* Added a non-hostile AI type. Can be used by custom NPCs. (Refer to help_npc.txt.)
* Pets who have a master/servant relationship of Amenable or above can now be given special commands via their conversation window.
** This allows you to set their AI to any of the non-hostile types, including the new AI and others that don't serve any purpose when used by your pets.
** To avoid taking away the raison d'etre of bard, prostitute, and cleaner NPCs, these NPCs (includes 6 unique NPCs) will now have double the range for their respective actions and gain double experience for doing them.
* NPCs [have a chance of changing their target] when having a little tail. If the initiator is a pet, or if both the initiator and the target are both within the player's sight, the target's name will now be displayed [in the log]. This is because the characters have to be adjacent to initiate it.
* NPCs' Preaching can no longer change the player's faith. Pets also no longer obtain Faith skill experience from NPCs' Preaching.
* Pets' Fascination Dance will no longer sap the stamina of other pets.
* Cleaners and <Balzak> the janiator will now also throw salt solutions at NPC snails when not in combat, so watch out for him if you have any snail pets. He will no longer throw salt solutions at the player or pets after getting recruited. That doesn't make him more useful though.
* Made the races for 2 unique NPCs display as elsia. It's just a cosmetic change; their actual race is still elea. This will not affect instances of those NPCs that were generated in previous versions.
* The equipment attributes granted by the black cat are no longer random, and the game will no longer auto-save.
** The type of equipment attribute gained will now depend on the target's Magic attribute, the black cat's Luck, and the player character's Luck. Strength of the equipment attribute is fixed.
** Only equipment attributes that grant resistances and attribute buffs are available now. This is so that none of the equipment attributes go to waste as there is no limit to how many of these you can stack.
** It would have been a lot more fitting to have crappy ones mixed into the list of equipment attributes available, but players would just load a save to get around that...
** It depends on magic and luck now to illustrate Ehekatl's hand in it.
* Increased the number of materials obtainable from gathering spots, made them harvestable in 1 search, and also made it auto-save.
** This is to prevent material harvesting from becoming routine work, as you could harvest just a bit from one spot then move on to another spot, then come back and harvest some more, and repeat that ad nauseam.
* Added 2 item fusion recipes.
* The ingredients for the junk make recipe no longer accept items that you can grab an infinite amount of. Also increased the number of items needed by 1 so that you can't keep using the recipe by inputting products as ingredients.
* Characters hit by molotov will now have 5 turns of Oil status ailment applied before applying the fire damage.
* NPCs that have the lulwy's photo collection item at their feet will now always fail to detect hostile enemies. They will still notice enemies when they get attacked though.
** They will also no longer catch any pickpocketing around them, as long as the item being stolen is not from their inventory.
* The bio battery item now negates green tea's weight loss effect as well.
* The show case of breads can now store puff puff bread, stick bread, and hamburger.
* Item stacking will be attempted after cooking.
* Uncooked fish will no longer decrease in freshness over time when they are placed on water tiles. You can use this to keep your catch alive and fresh or run an aquarium.
* You can now make uncooked fresh fish [reproduce] by giving it a special type of feed. Uncooked fish will now have their size calculated from their individual weight, and then have that size [prefixed] to their name. When their weight is increased by feeding them, their selling price will increase as well.
* Made fish obtained from fishing have variation in weight and price. Their weight will now range from 80% to 160% of their original base weight.
** The smaller fish may appear to have the same weight, but that can be because of rounding of the displayed weight. Junk items have fixed weight. Also rebalanced whale weight, as they were kind of light.
* Uncooked fish will now have their size calculated from their individual weight, and then have that size [prefixed] to their name. Also rebalanced coconut crab weight, as they were kind of heavy.
* Uncooked fish that is not rotten can now be given fish food to increase their +enhance value, up to a maximum of +15.
** Like vegetables, the +enhance value will increase the fish selling price and experience gained from eating it.
* Greatly decreased the stamina cost of using 4-dimensional pocket. Increased the spell power of 4-dimensional pocket available from a 4-Dimensional mirror. This is to balance out the fact that fish does not stack as nicely now.
* Under "Attack Animation" in "Screen & Sound" in the config menu, you can now toggle attack animations for NPCs separately. You can also choose to turn them on only for pets.
* Increased the amount of experience passively earned for Light, Medium, and Heavy Armor skills.
* Every 50 levels of Armor skill will now decrease the Pierce of the attacker's weapon by 1%.
** e.g. When getting attacked by an attacker with a 50% Pierce and you have 1000 in your Armor skill, the effective Pierce is 40%. With 2000 Armor skill, it's 30%. Effect is limited at half of the weapon's Pierce.
** There is no change to their contribution to PV; it's still capped at [skill level] 300. There is also no effect on absolute piercing attacks.
** This is to reduce the effect of weapon pierce stat and to increase the usefulness of the 3 armor skills.
* Added an NPC to discourage afk grinding.
** If the player character remains on the same tile and physical attacks keep getting used, a warning message will now get displayed.
** If the player still does not move, the NPC will then get summoned regardless of where the player is - be it in the showroom or at home. (The player is invincible in the pet arena, so it'll just cause an automatic defeat after 1000 turns and boot the player out.)
** It will have its stats buffed a lot and also trigger ragnarok.
** It won't spawn as long as you don't afk with a key held down. It also doesn't have any special animation effects or anything, so you won't be missing out on anything if you don't see it.
** This NPC can also be randomly generated, albeit unbuffed.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some descriptions.
* Fixed slicing animation for regular attacks changing rotation every frame.
* Fixed bolt spells being able to hit targets out of sight.
* Fixed the seminar attended variable getting reset if the date changes in the Adventure Seminar classroom.


==1.77==
'''4/30/2018'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added 3 new dinosaur race NPCs.
* Added a new item that maintains your character's height and weight when you have it in your inventory.
* Added 3 new special actions, all learnable by the player.
* Added 1 new item fusion recipe.
* Eye of Mana special action now inflicts MPoison on the target as well. Strength of MPoison is dependent on the user's Magic attribute.
* Increased Collected Power special action's HP and MP recovery effect from 2% to 5%.
* Slightly lowered the base power of the Smash Ground special action but increased its random variance in power. It will now cause 1 to 5 turns of Wince instead of a fixed 1 turn. There should be randomness in how much a target gets hit by shrapnel and debris, after all.
* Lowered the base power of the Gravity Sphere special action and made it dependent on both Magic and Constitution instead of just Constitution alone. It now also has a multiplier on its power which increases based on the number of turns the target is afflicted with Gravity (just like Giga Gravitation).
* Rebalanced the power of the Graviton Buster gauge attack. It had a tendency of being more powerful than other gauge attacks because it was dependent on the average of Constitution and the current map's danger level instead of [weapon] skill level. As such, the effect of danger level on its power has been reduced.
* Reduced the effect of equipment attribute strength on spell power for the "combine ____ spells" equipment attributes. Their effects are now capped at 1.5x the spell power of the original spell casted by the user. The equipment attribute is now slightly more common.
* Changed the visual effect for Distant Attack for whips.
* There is now a meat quality modifier on the sale price of pets sold to the slave master. This means that they'll sell for more after some Rubbing on the ranch. Even putting seasoning on them will make a difference.
* Added an option to the interact menu with ranch animals including the breeder.
** It allows you to receive a monster part of your choice from the target.
** Usable when the target's HP is full, and will deal the target's max HP in damage and reduce its Life by 3/4.
** The part will have no +enhance value and doing this will kill the target very quickly, but unlike milking the wait time is shorter and it can be used multiple times in succession.
* Death Word didn't do much in late-game, so it will now deal the target's maximum HP + 1 in damage instead of only 9,999 when the countdown hits 0. With this, surviving it is possible even at low level if you use anything that increases HP beyond maximum HP, such as the breath gauge attack. Also, when an NPC picks a target for Death Word or Death Song and that target is 100% resistant to Death Word, it will now pick another move out of its AI routine to use.
* The Restore Body spell now recovers 3 sp, and the Restore Spirit spell now increases power gauge by 4% if it is currently less than 50%. They need to be repeatedly used to be useful - this so that they'll get used more often like their potion counterparts.
* When the handful of snow item is the target of the "Poison drips from your hands" disease feat, it will now melt and disappear instead of turning into a poison. 
* Added some English translations.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some descriptions.
* Fixed NPCs' custom portraits not always getting displayed in the conversation window when talking to them.
* Fixed Alchemical Rain so that it no longer makes targets Wet with essential oil and gasoline. 
* Fixed an auto-save occurring for a certain Act III sub quest even when in wizard mode.
* Fixed Sense Object/scroll of detect objects' see invisibility effect sometimes lasting beyond the player's turn and into the next NPC's turn.
* Fixed the player character being treated as the breeder if there is currently none assigned for the ranch.
* Fixed the overflow that could sometimes occur when calculating inventory burden.


==1.76fix==
'''3/2/2018'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Temporarily made loop and sub code levels display near the date to help find an infinite loop. Both of these numbers should eventually settle on a single-digit number after increasing and decreasing for a bit. If they are about 10 to 20 and still keep increasing from there, please send a report because that's the cause of the crash.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed activating the effect of "it enchances your charging" equipment attribute a total of 30 times without loading the game in-between causing the game to crash.
* Fixed the player's [hits] received counter not getting reset at the start of his turn.


==1.76==
'''3/1/2018'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added a new game mode filled with overpowered features. This one's for those who like things like save scumming, afk leveling in idle games, brute forcing everything, and being very stronk and powerfull in general.
* Introduced a damage-reducing combo system to curb the effectiveness of overwhelming enemies with an excess of hand slots. This will apply to both the player's side as well as enemies.
** The 50th [to 59th] hit received by a target before its next turn will be reduced by 20%, the 60th [to 79th] hit by 30%, the 80th [to 100th] by 40%, the 100th attack onwards by 50%, and on on. The 200th attack a target receives before its next turn will end up doing only 1 damage.
** However, Continuous attacks, Dance of blow, Shadow rush, Knockout, and Fire a volley will not count towards the combo counter.
** The 10th attack and after will cause the number of attacks to displayed below [the target].
* 3 new Nefia in South Tyris, unrelated to the [main] quest. Each of them has a new unique NPC boss equipped with a unique artifact.
* New status ailment: MPoison (changes to "Emission" at high severity). This is the MP version of bleeding. Like Poisoned and Bleeding, MP regeneration will not happen when inflicted with this. Unique NPCs are more resistant to it. Characters cannot become resistant towards it, but using any means to recover MP will reduce its severity. Also added a new bad equipment attribute that procs this status ailment at random.
* Another 3 new equipment attributes on top of the aforementioned.
* Having to equip every single member of your party with fire resist equip for that early-game mid-boss dungeon might be too difficult and time-consuming for beginners, so the ambient fire damage for the Tower of Fire has been reduced.
* Corrected the danger level displayed for Fort of Chaos Nefia. Their actual danger level remains the same. It used to be more for flavour than to reflect the actual difficulty of what's inside, but players had to look things up on the internet to be able to know if they're ready for it.
* Discs marked as important will no longer get counted nor handed over when making a Juke box.
* NPCs' power gauge will now increase when they idle during their turn if they have 70% or less in their gauge. This condition was previously set to 80% or less.
* Added 4 new tiles for maps. All of these are transparent.
* faceN_A.bmp and face_Q.bmp can now be used for evochat portraits to portray anger and puzzlement. I didn't intend to create any more of these evochat states, but here we are. If it's too much trouble to make more of your portraits, just copy the files and rename them. That said, the game will try to display the character [sprite] instead if it can't find those files to prevent crashing.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some descriptions.
* Fixed the equip update item fusion recipe not changing the ranged weapon that arrows and bolts will work with. Ammo that have already been used in the recipe will have their weapon type corrected the next time they are used for a ranged attack.
* Fixed Murder Knight not having the code to recruit it after defeating it, and Lityou having two copies of that code.
* Fixed recruiting a certain Act III unique NPC with an astral light pen then talking to it on the same map it was on triggering the conversation for a game event.
* Fixed astral light pen copies of 2 unique NPCs getting turned in for their respective escort quests instead of the actual NPCs themselves, causing the remaining unique NPC in your party to have the escort bit flag. If you have already handed over the NPCs, interacting with the pet in your party will now remove its escort bit flag.
* Fixed the issue with the description for the skill-buffing equipment attribute.
* Fixed the random unique NPC added in 1.75 being able to spawn more than once.
* Fixed being able to buy the drug kiseru item with insufficient money, causing money on hand to go negative. It seemed kind of neat though, because going into debt to buy drugs feels realistic.
* Fixed killing the target NPCs for arenas and hunting quests alongside other NPCs causing the arena/quest to get cleared multiple times.
* Fixed stacking items with 'I' key so that items of the same type will no longer have their item value and and freshness set to the same value. Meaning that it will no longer make tadpoles and whales fetch the same price.

==1.75==
'''1/8/2018'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added the ability to insert tags into custom NPC talk. Having a tag in a custom talk line will display the corresponding emoticon along with it. If the "atmosphere" evochat portraits are set [for that particular pet], then those will change with the line spoken as well. When a tag is used in an evochat line, then the corresponding [evochat portrait] for that tag will be displayed instead of the default for that evochat line.
** {Basic} - clears emotes currently being displayed when this line is spoken.
** {Embarrassment}- displays the blush icon when this line is spoken.
** {Fun} - displays the musical note icon when this line is spoken.
** {Happy} - displays the heart icon when this line is spoken.
** {Angry} - displays the angry icon when this line is spoken. Atmosphere portrait is the same as Basic.
** {Question} - displays the ? icon when this line is spoken. Atmosphere portrait is the same as Basic.
** To prevent confusion, status ailment icons can't be used.
* Added evochat conversation options.
* The same types of items can now be put together into the stack with the lowest freshness and price with the 'I' key.
* Pets assigned as breeders on the ranch will now lay eggs and produce milk as well, and can also be milked.
* Reduced the effect of weight on the price of shit.
* Added 2 rather special NPCs.
* 2 performaids now have their own sprites instead of having a recoloured one. Does not affect existing NPCs.
* NPCs who have brackets around their names like a unique NPC but aren't actually unique NPCs so that the shopkeeper code will work for them (i.e. Aile, Lend, and Moyer) will now contribute towards unique level in the museum. It's too much trouble to explain why they don't count even though they look unique.
* Increased kagami mochi's effect when eaten by 50%.
* Added 3 new item fusion recipes.
* Added 3 new items.
* Added 1 new equipment attribute.
* Eating equipment with an equipment attribute that buffs a skill will now give experience towards that skill. When on a food item, the attribute's description will automatically change to "It will be experience of ____".
* When recruiting god NPCs and inheriting pets via soul spindle, temporary attribute increases and decreases will now get reset when applying attribute reductions. This means that those temporary attribute changes will not carry over to the new pet.
* Increased the chance that guests at your home will despawn after some time from 50% to 80%.
* Gravity Accel will now protect characters from puddles of acid on the ground as well.
* Changed the damage reduction calculation for Mani's gem stone of satellite shooter, Resolution Hand, and Homing Lazer so that they are reduced by PV+DV instead.
* Fascination Dance special action will now sap the stamina of non-pet NPCs as well. If it succeeds in applying paralysis, then this effect is doubled.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some descriptions.
* Fixed the overflow that could occur while multiplying or dividing numbers for yacatect's bank. Using a bank that had overflowed will refund 210 million gold.
* Fixed the lag that was occurring while stacking items when generating an NPC shop's inventory.
* Fixed repeatedly quitting and restarting the game in the middle of a conversation with a guest at your home causing the number of guests to go eventually negative, preventing new guests from visiting. Removed the auto-save as well. If the number of guests is already negative, it will be reset to 0 when the date changes.
* Fixed a typo causing the stack handler to produce a carpenter's tool and a gem cutter from the wood craft and stone craft item fusion recipes.
* Fixed sprites that are not red fires showing up [around the clock] during fever mode.
* Fixed some mistakes in Vessel's placement in Act III.
* Also fixed a separate issue where loading a map during certain events would place NPCs on it even when they really should not be there for those events.


==1.74fix==
'''12/25/2017'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added just a bit of Act III main quest content.
* The amount of money that the player starts with is now different for the various game modes. The calculation for amount of money inherited from a gene is still the same; the amount inherited is added to the base amount for that game mode.
* Pets will no longer share money earned from selling ores and flowers with their tag partner if they are currently teamed with the player.
* Target items for delivery quests that have been obtained from town NPCs will now stack with items of the same type. They weren't stacking before even though they were worth the same and didn't rot because of client data [on the target item].

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some descriptions.
* Added a precaution against issues that could occur when furniture that have an inventory get their inventory pointer overwritten with quest client data when they are the target item of a delivery quest. This fix affects existing furniture pieces from previous versions.
* Fixed NPC names getting prefixed on to dried fish made on from drying fish obtained from fishing on a dryrock. Does not affect existing dried fish from previous versions.
* Fixed defeating a certain Act III boss in a previous version causing an event to happen twice, duplicating enemies and causing players to get double-teamed.
* Players can no longer Return directly to the deepest floor of the Act III main Nefia. They will now Return to one floor before the deepest floor cleared.
* Fixed the mix up in animation for regular picnic basket and the new item.
* Fixed pets in Defence mode throwing potions if an evolution had changed the type of potions they throw.


==1.74==
'''12/18/2017'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Additional Act III main quest content. Mostly an event battle.
* Added 3 unique NPCs for Act III.
* Changed the AI for 2 existing characters. Will not affect instances of those characters that were generated in previous versions.
* astral light pen can now be used on monsters with <> or {} brackets around their names. The copies won't have the levels of the original, but they will have the resistances intrinsic to unique NPC pets.
* The calculation that reduces gained experience as attributes and skill levels increase has been changed. When attributes and skill levels are greater than 300, the calculation will use 300 as their values. This means that players will no longer need to choose between going to extreme lengths to level them or giving up on them.
* Every successive melee and ranged attack in a series will now have a lower chance of scoring a critical.
* Changed the lower bound for NPC stamina to -50. You can now 'l'ook at targets to see how much stamina they have.
* Museums will now have a 'Unique Level' in addition to their rank.
** This is the sum of the levels of the unique NPCs that dropped the figures in the museum.
** (Cards and duplicate figures will not be counted, nor will figures that belong to NPCs that have a level that is 2x or greater than your deepest dungeon floor cleared.)
** The level will be recalculated and displayed when figures are placed or removed, and will be 0 by default for save files from previous versions.
** If the level is greater than 1, the player will receive a mysterious envelope in every salary received. The envelope will contain a Unique Level-dependent number of platinum pieces.
** No envelope will be received in the salary while the player is in the Deep-sea castle.
** This increases the usefulness of the museum and act as an additional source of platinum pieces.
** The earlier the player obtains those figures, the earlier they will start benefiting from it. This will hopefully be motivation for players to challenge mid-bosses and high level unique NPCs as soon as they can.
** This should supplement existing methods of obtaining platinum pieces, but if it ends up supplanting them then it will be rebalanced.
** There are about 200 unique NPCs including the gods, so there should still be enough space in the museum to place non-unique figures.
* Greatly reduced the effect of the smoking debuff as well as its length. The increase in tobacco dependency and maximum dependency have also been decreased, but will no longer be affected by +enhance values.
** Tobacco dependence percentage is also now displayed when smoking.
** Tobacco generated in versions before 1.73 are [now] usable in 1.74.
* Sense Object can now detect traps, hidden passages, and small medals within its area of effect, so it's a lot more useful now. This does not apply to cursed or doomed scrolls however.
* Vegetables, fruits, and fish can now be turned into 5 dried vegetables, dried fruits, and dried fish respectively on dryrock. This works the same as jerky production. Dried food cannot be made from ingredients that been treated with antiseptic or do not rot, as the items are transformed into their dried versions when they would have otherwise rotted.
* Added Opatos, Kumiromi, and Lulwy merchandise.
* Added 1 randomly-generated artifact.
* Added 1 more new item. It can be purchased if conditions are met. You will also get 1 of it placed at your feet as a sample product if you update your game before 12/25 in real life.
* Implemented the drug kiseru item's effects.
* Added 1 item fusion recipe. Has to be unlocked with its recipe item like soma.
* Sound effects for the Melancholy and Distracted debuff no longer play when the source is outside the player's field of vision.
* The game will no longer roll to apply Melancholy debuff [on characters that have] 100% or more power gauge.
* Added a new equipment attribute for ranged weapons.
* When encountering bandits and the player is above level 50, the calculation for bandit strength will now use 50 as the player's level.
* Made slight changes to the items harvestable from unknown seeds for each season.
* When zapping rods and when successfully charging rods, the game will now attempt to stack the targeted item.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed an oversight causing certain Act III mid-bosses to be capturable with monster balls.
* Fixed some NPCs not using special actions gained from evolution.
* Fixed items in your shop becoming temporarily invisible if you sleep in it while there is no shopkeeper and the date changes.
* Fixed NPCs being tired when they are spawned from summoning and having only 80% speed as a result. Summoning sickness isn't a thing.
* Fixed the typo that was preventing cursed acidproof and fireproof liquids from decreasing the +enhance value of equipment.
* Fixed Concentration buff having a fixed strength.
* Fixed using tobacco items on the ground caused them to leave behind their sprite.
* Fixed TxtShift custom lines added in 1.73 looking up the wrong NPCs.


==1.73==
'''10/29/2017'''
 [Changes and additions]
* The game will now set play time to 0 when loading save files with a negative play time.
* Added Ehekatl, Itzpalt, and Yacatect merchandise.
* Implemented effects for the 6 types of tobacco that didn't have any effect. All of them except suigara [cigarette butt] will inherit the +enhance value from the tobacco they are crafted from. However, cigarette, hamaki, tobacco pipe, and kiseru generated in previous versions will have no effects [in 1.73].
* Added 2 new debuffs.
* NPCs that have 100% or more gauge, are in combat, have yet to transform, and have a usable shift core in their inventory will now automatically use it to transform. This will not take any turns. If they have multiple shift cores in their inventory, they will use the last available one in the Greek alphabetical order. Transforming like this will not bring up the dialog for customizing appearance after transformation, so be sure to have it set up in advance.
* Lines spoken while transforming can now be customized with txtShift.
* Removed the game mechanic that gave a 1 to 1/3 satiety-dependent multiplier to experience gained when eating without any of the "Hungry" statuses. This multiplier is now fixed at x3 for food that is not rotten, and x1 for rotten food.
* NPCs will now get a speed reduction when their speed is recalculated and their stamina is below a threshold. Their stamina will still not decrease after using special actions. Their stamina will recover with the passage of turns and is affected by Regeneration, but is not affected by Kumiromi worship.
* NPCs can now gain and lose stamina from the equipment attribute that absorbs stamina and Drain Blood. Neither the player nor NPCs can absorb stamina from targets that have 0 or less stamina.
* NPCs and players are no longer able to use Dupli-Cane when stamina is 0 or below.
* Made Bind status ailment decrease stamina by 1 every turn. This is to sort of simulate tiredness for characters struggling to break free.
* Converge Breath of the player's summoned undead will no longer hit the player and pets.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some descriptions.
* Fixed NPCs with sprite numbers of 1000 and above appearing glitched when they undergo shift core transformation and when their transformation expires.
* Added measures to prevent crashes from occurring when salary is paid.
* Fixed the discrepancy between the direction of attack and the visual effect for Critical Particle Cannon.
* Fixed the crash that occurred when falling asleep without using a bed.
* Edited some parts of the 1.72 detailed changelog to include the last-minute changes.


==1.72==
'''10/7/2017'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added Act I events. The conditions to trigger these are separate from the triggers for the Act I main quest. This means that if you have already cleared Lesimas you can still start them by walking through the dungeon starting from the top floor.
* Made an Act III event's unique NPC have a 25% chance of recovering from unconsciousness at the beginning of every turn and also display a message. The chance used to be 100%.
* Added 10 new NPCs.
* Added 1 new evolution.
* Added 1 new special action.
* Added 2 new items.
* Made Jure's body pillow have a special effect. When used as a bed, it increases the chance that the Regeneration, Gaining Faith, Your Potential, and Development random events will occur by 5 to 10 times. Other random events will have a lower chance of occurring except for Lucky Day, Treasure of Dream, and Quirk of Fate.
* Item fusion recipes that made products that weren't always blessed or cursed will now always make products that are neither blessed nor cursed.
* Scrolls of name can now rename ammos.
* Added the option to bet 10 chips in blackjack. Also added the option to fold, which is available as long as you still have 2 or more chips left in the bet. 1 chip will be deducted from your bet, but you will keep your win streak. The quality of prizes won will also be reduced correspondingly by 1 chip, but it can be worth it since 1 win has a larger effect on the prizes received than 1 chip.
* Split the items that vegetable, fruit, magic, and unknown seed crops yield into groups. Each item group will be harvestable during different times of the year. This is to introduce harvesting seasons to make it seem a bit more like farming. From a player's perspective, items are going to stack 4 times as easily and rods of wishing are also going to be more easily obtainable.
* Made some balance changes to the prices of some fruits and vegetables.
* NPCs' auto-turn will now be interrupted when they join you as a pet.
* The player's Impress will no longer increase when getting bashed by an NPC while choking on a mochi.
* Added an option to use the tamer's whip on NPCs for no reason at all. Unlike the other options, this may cause the target to become hostile.
* The message displayed when interrupting an NPC who is eating by walking into its tile will now change depending on the sum of its Impress and servant/master relationship score with you.
* Changed the mechanic that had a random chance of awarding a random number of small medals after clearing a random Nefia. The chance awarding small medals will now depend on the danger level of the Nefia (the difficulty of the first floor where the entrance is located); small medals will never be awarded if danger level is 50 or below. When awarding small medals, the number given will be 1, plus an additional one for fever mode, and another if it was an awakened Nefia.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some descriptions.
* Fixed satiety recovered not being half of regular values when having a meal together in 1.71.
* Fixed being unable to use king heart on fallen soldier.
* Fixed the mix up in skill levels required to craft hard materium and hard high materium.
* Fixed the player getting moved twice and ending up on the world map when leaving the map on the same turn that the timer runs out for timed town board quests.


==1.71==
'''9/10/2017'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Implemented the final dungeon floor of Act III, including the battle.
* Added an Act III unique NPC and a unique artifact.
* Each ammo type will now have their own gauge attack (i.e. there are 5 new gauge attacks). None of these can be parried with melee weapons, but the damage will be reduced by Greater Evasion skill as long as the roll for the latter is successful. Both the chance of damage reduction and the multiplier for that reduction are half of those for Greater Evasion's effect on melee attacks.
* The player character will now receive more level experience when an enemy with a higher level is defeated. The greater the level gap, the more the experience gained, up to 10 times more.
* Player characters are now exempt from taxes and attribute loss when crawling up after dying until level 10 instead of level 6.
* Removed the Life penalty for Icolle's body part removal service.
* Changed the sound effect for whip's distance attack to something easier on the ears.
* Made a slight change to the log description for decapitation with ranged attacks.
* The equipment attribute that protects you from thieves will now work against Scavenge like it works against getting pickpocketed.
* Added male and female versions of sprites for thief, robber, and master thief. These sprites still resemble the original and shouldn't seem too out of place.
* Added 4 new evolutions.
* MP gauge for NPCs is now displayed between their HP and power gauges.
* Added (1/2 of the target's current HP) as a condition to the cap on the amount of damage that can be absorbed as HP with a nether-element attack. However, this will change to (1/10 of the target's maximum HP) if the nether-element attack kills the target.
* When sandbagged NPCs have all their HP depleted, they will now recover only 1 HP instead of fully recovering.
* Wire traps set by the player are now visible after setting them. Made the way they display clearer.
* Reduced the effect of materials and equipment attributes on equipment prices. Decreased the minimum price of equipment sold at the player's shop.
* Added Throwing skill-dependent random damage for throwing tofu. This damage will occur whether the tofu has an +enhance value or not.
* Pot of alchemist can no longer be used in the showroom.
* In previous versions, Sense Quality gave a skill level-dependent random chance of identifying the quality and material of equipment during their generation. This will now happen at 100% chance at skill level 50 and above. In addition to that, the skill will now also work on non-equipment items, identifying them [at random] with the passage of turns. However, non-equipment items will not get identified during auto turns, and only up to 5 items will get identified at a time. The log will not describe the identification of individual non-equipment items to prevent it from getting clogged up. These items will also be automatically stacked after identification.
* Changed the chance of additional enemies spawning in Nefia to 1/20.
* Increased the enhance limit of enchant weapon and armor scrolls (both regular and greater) by 1.
* Coffins of necromancy can now be used in their own item fusion recipe to remake them.
* Added 8 new item fusion recipes. Did some reordering of the recipe list.
* Replaced 6 items craftable from materials with 6 new ones. These intermediate products can then be used to make a piece of miracle-quality equipment of your choice in item fusion, or to change the piece of equipment into another type in its category (like helm to knight helm).
* Reduced, changed, and removed some of the material requirements for item crafting.
* Added 4 new materials, and changed some of the ingredients required in recipes to those (especially ones that are required in a lot of recipes like paper).
* Made 7 existing items craftable with the sewing kit.
* Increased experience gain from crafting items from materials. Items crafted this way will be identified, unblessed and uncursed, and automatically stacked.
* Equipment degradation by acid or by the Abnormal game mode effect now has its own sound effect. There is also a [visual] effect that plays when equipment is degraded to -10 (i.e. the piece of equipment is about to be destroyed) in Abnormal game mode.
* Level of small gamble chests sold by shops now depends on the shop's invest level, so you may want to invest in inn shops.
* Unlocking doors and chests now give experience based on the unlock difficulty. This bonus is higher for chests that need lockpicks.
* Reduced the effect of weight on egg prices from up to 20 times to 8 times. This means that eggs that are too light are no longer going to be worth so little that they aren't worth selling, and eggs that are extremely heavy aren't going to be that valuable either.
* Made cancelling hardening of weapon and armour at the blacksmith display the "You kidding?" line instead of a normal conversation line.
* Reduced the spawn rate of Unknown Shell and rabbit's tail to 2/3 of that in previous versions after taking into consideration the spawn rate and reproductive power of the NPCs they drop from.
* If there is an impassable tile like a wall or door on the starting coordinate of a monster variant (NB: those monsters with brackets around their names) or unique non-pet NPC, the game will now destroy that tile and spawn the NPC.
* You can now talk to guards hired at your home to kick out an NPC. Pets, NPCs hired by you, and adventurers cannot be selected. The ones that you can kick out include guests that don't seem to want to go away, monsters spawned from spellbook reading failures, and inner gods. The time for guards to actually do their job has come!

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some descriptions.
* Removed the visual effect for pregnancy that occurs when having a meal together and eating a corpse with that effect as it was glitching up.
* Fixed coffins of necromancy losing necro remodel effect when they are used but fail to deploy due to a lack of space.
* Fixed decapitation with Blade Strings after shooting with a gun getting described as shooting the target in the head instead.
* Fixed cancelling the conversation with the caravan master displaying "You kidding?".


==1.70==
'''7/24/2017'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Explicitly prevented the game from connecting to the new third-party Japanese chat server meant for vanilla Elona that was set up with Noa's permission. The game will not connect if the address for that server is specified in the server.txt.
** NB: the following line was already in English:
** [Please don't make it possible to connect to noaneko.squares.net% by modification.]
* Added an Act III sub quest (Arasiel's).
* Potentials will no longer decrease when attributes and skill levels are increased by a fixed amount (NB: like by quaffing from wells).
* Added a new monster.
* Made fever mode affect only random Nefia.
* Damage for Shining Wave, Smash Ground, Blade Strings, Golden Storm, Rocket Fire, Nuclear Fire, and Hyper Dash special actions is now divided by the sum of PV and DV.
* NPCs on the same side will no longer run each other over with Hyper Dash.
* Added 2 new special actions. One of them is for NPC use only.
* Made the sound effect for Collected Power play only if the user is within sight.
* Increased frequency of melee and ranged attack (NB: purchased with AP) now has a higher priority than seal magic and seal ability.
* Added 1 new unique artifact.
* Added 4 new items. Added 2 new item fusion recipes.
* Added a new buff that increases Constitution and Charisma. Added a new potion and spellbook for it. The aforementioned 4 new items don't include these.
* Cost of identifying and investigating items now depends on fame instead of Negotiation. (It's cheaper when fame is lower.) Caps out at 100,000 fame.
* Made green tea decrease the vomit counter by 1.
* Changed the name of the "fake gold" recipe to "junk make" to reflect the type of items produced by the recipe.
* Made slight changes to the ingredients for the makenn tensei and shin makenn tensei recipes.
* Made food train Speed attribute by an amount dependent on their +enhance value. This applies even if the food item does not usually train Speed.
* Increased the chance that general vendors will sell monster balls.
* Items harvested from crops will no longer be blessed nor cursed.

 [Fixes]
* Potions of cure corruption will no longer have +enhance values when harvested from unknown seeds.
* Fixed cards generated during marriage not being able to handle sprite numbers 1000 and above.
* Fixed pets having a chance to not speak their default lines when eating together them when they have no custom [txtMeal] line set. Added an alternate line.
* A graphical glitch was occurring when resistances were increased from having a meal together with pets, so the visual effects will no longer play when eating together.
* Fixed pets being unable to eat anything unless their satiety has decreased to the new [lower] minimum set the previous update. They are now able to eat when their satiety reaches the old minimum.
* Fixed pets not earning any money from selling wild flowers in towns.
* Fixed being unable to enchant equipment asides from melee and ranged weapons with the remote blow equipment attribute.
* Fixed there being duplicate checks (e.g. karma penalty) for NPC deaths occurring on a puddle of acid/potion or in a pillar of fire.


==1.69==
'''6/25/2017'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Removed all netcode for the Japanese version from the source. The input box for chat no longer appears when the tab key is pressed.
* There is now a phenomenon that may occur on the 15th and after of months that are not a multiple of 3. This will cause all Nefia to go into fever mode. Like the etherwind, this has a high random chance of occurring. It will not last beyond the end of the month. If Extra Help is not turned off in the settings, Norne will appear and give an explanation the first time this happens. In fever-mode Nefia, a [floor danger level]-dependent number of music tickets (up to 70 tickets) will be generated on tiles on which the floor's gold pieces have been placed. There will also be more material gathering spots, less fountains, and more altars generated. Items generated on the ground will have their level increased and be identified by default. Strength of enemies remains the same.
* Added just a bit of Act III main quest content.
* Added 2 new special actions. One of them is for NPCs only.
* Decreased the increase in Magic when the exile evolves, made the evolution grant Control Magic skill, and also give increased skill levels in that skill. Similarly, the evolution to witch will also give less of a Magic attribute increase, grant Control Magic skill, and more levels in that skill.
* Added 4 new slime race NPCs and 1 new evolution.
* Added 1 new catsister NPC.
* Changed the chance of summoning a fox brother from a mysterious diary from 2% to once every 12 diaries.
* The younger sister shopkeeper will start off with the Oti-Tubaki equipped. In combat, she will now fight in addition to summoning younger sisters. This will not affect younger sister shopkeepers already generated in previous versions. Regular younger sisters will no longer be randomly equipped with the Oti-Tubaki.
* Doubled the chance of Life and Mana increase when eating a Little sister corpse, and made it affected by the rare loot trigger.
* Monster balls crafted with item fusion no longer have a random level, and will now always depend on the deepest dungeon floor cleared. Upper limit 140.
* Deed of heirship now lets you inherit a fixed 3 items instead of a random number of items.
* Added a new item fusion recipe that allows you to convert items into gold pieces. The number of gold pieces is somewhat lower than if you had sold the item to a shopkeeper (the calculation and sell price cap are both 80% of a shop's). This is for when your inventory is full. The number of gold pieces you will receive is listed in the steps section. Each conversion is limited to a maximum of 9,999gp. As for items that usually cannot be sold, precious items and rotten food will fetch 1 gold piece each, and trade goods will have no region price modifier.
* Bronze coins generate identified, uncursed and unblessed.
* Added 3 new items that can be made from milk in item fusion.
* Added 1 new unique artifact.
* Pets who have the prerequisite skills for breakfast or handmade gift events but are not the target NPC for those events can now help out. When helping out, half of their relevant skill levels will be added to the target NPC's skill levels, and they will also receive half the amount of experience. They can help out even if they are holding on to a pleasant sleep blanket. This means that it's no longer a waste for multiple pets to have those skills.
* There are now separate Carpentry and Tailoring versions of the Handmade Gift event. Made slight changes to names and descriptions to match.
* The value to which pet satiety will decrease to over time has been decreased. This value is between where the player's status will say Hungry and where there will be no hunger status displayed. This basically means that pets can eat more times.
* Added an option to eat together with pets who are at Friend or above if neither the player nor the pet has anorexia. This option, available in the conversation window, will select a non-rotten and non-cursed rank 5 or above cooked food item and share it with your pet. The prerequisites are somewhat troublesome, but the food item will give half the normal satiety but a full amount of all other effects. No auto-turn will occur, and the item will be considered eaten when the conversation ends. Added a new txtMeal NPC custom line for this.
* Purchased items will have their price during purchase saved. When selling these items at your shop, their sale price will be capped at 1/3+1 of the purchase price regardless of shop type.
* If not all pieces of equipment on a character are acid proof, then the weak point list will include acid. If the character does not have any equipment that diminishes bleeding and prevents aliens from entering the body, then the weak point list will also include bleeding and pregnancy respectively.
* NPCs can no longer destroy walls on the world map.
* Changed [sprites] of the cupid of love-type monsters while retaining some resemblance to the original sprite.
* When Bewitch special action succeeds, you will now receive money even from NPCs that are currently hostile to you. It will also not increase the target's power gauge. Increased the decrease in Attract.
* Edited the red book on managing shops.
* Shopkeepers for your shop can now gain a feat when they have 120 and above sales exp, and another at 360 and above sales exp. For now, there are five feats available that you can choose from, and there may be more in the future if I think of some more.
* Changed how all types of player shops except for the goods shop work. Items types that the shop type specializes in will have a 1.2x multiplier on sale price and an increased chance of selling. Item types that the shop does not specialize in will now have a 1.0x multiplier, but have a decreased chance of selling. Changing shop types no longer costs money.
* Decreased the base price of items sold at your shop. Also, sale price of items sold at your shop is now capped at 36% of item value, which is slightly higher than the sale price of items when selling to NPC shopkeepers (30% of item value). The shop type price modifiers (1.2x) are applied after this price cap. Even after this 1.2x multiplier, item sell price will still be 43.2% of buy price at maximum Negotiation, causing a 6.8% loss when reselling purchased items. Equipment used to have an additional 1/3 multiplier, but that has been abolished.
* Added a new floor tile and a new transparent wall tile. The default player shop map will come with these, and they also available in the tile palette for other player-owned maps. These tiles also have a special effect - placing items on these tile in your shop will stop those item from getting sold. They can be used for interior decoration.
* Draw Charge special action can no longer be used on items marked as important.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed Icolle's body part reset for zombie race characters causing them to have 1 less hand.
* Fixed resistance increase from eating healer, sister, and yith corpses still being random. Removed the effect from the corpse of the unique town NPC Renai.
* Decapitation that procs from Tactical Attack [AP feat] will no longer get affected by ranged attacks occurring right before it and will now always display the text for head lopping.
* Fixed weight display for characters after eating livestock feed showing the old weight.
* Fixed objet of heart listing nerve as a weakness when nether resistance is low.
* Fixed regular attacks executed in place of Rocket Fire special action [by NPCs when Rocket fire is an invalid move] using the last weapon looked up by the game as the ranged weapon.
* Removed hostile action check that occurred after applying Clash Rush special action damage.
* Fixed +enhance value not getting taken into account for wild flowers sold by pets in town.
* Fixed gauge values of 101% or more displaying as 100% for the pet on the left in a tag team.
* Fixed quick shooting still being able to counter attacks when time is stopped.
* Fixed pets not using rods of bubble ball when they change maps after being handed the rod. If using a save file from a previous version, you will need to take away that rod and give it to them again in order to make them use it.


==1.68==
'''5/29/2017'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Renamed the following game modes:
** Advancing -> Essential
** Inferno -> Loss
** No future -> Abnormal
** Coming next is a game mode that starts with the letter P.
* Added a bit of Act III main quest content.
* Added 1 unique artifact for Act III.
* Added 3 new items, and two new item fusion recipes for them.
* Added 5 new largeanimal NPCs.
* Decreased influence of level and increased influence of attributes on maximum HP and MP. The formula is about halfway between that in [previous versions] and vanilla Elona.
* Meshera-type NPCs will no longer regenerate health and have their HP decreased every turn if they are outdoors and the etherwind is blowing, or when they are on certain maps. This HP decrease is not damage, so they will not die from it.
* Talon soldiers will now have a unique ability that gives an additional +2 to their power gauge when they attack. There will be a description that pops up when talon soldiers and fin crocodiles [gain this ability].
* NPCs are now able to destroy walls and doors when buffed with Hyper Dash.
* Adventure Seminar has a new map sprite.
* Using items with a cooldown time via shortcut keys after exiting the Deep-sea castle but before sleeping will now reset their cooldown time.
* Increased the base price of items sold in your shop. Items that have a price of less than 50gp before modifiers (e.g. cooked food rank or +enhance value bonus) can now be sold in your shop.
* Shopkeeper crows visiting your shop will now speak generic lines instead of their special lines.
* Individual spells can now be hidden in the spell list like special actions.
* The time display will show *debug* when in wizard mode to make it more distinguishable from regular game modes.
* Highest damage dealt record no longer counts decapitation damage.
* Hunting targets for the Fighters Guild will now be less than twice the player's level. It used to be less than thrice the player's level. Other than that, the level formula remains the same.
* The uncursing service of healers now depends on fame. Lower limit is 300, upper limit 3000.
* Item types that have been identified before (i.e. their name is known, sell price is not 1gp, but blessed/cursed status is unknown) will now cost less to identify. Equipment do not qualify for discount.
* 1,000gp is not an insignificant sum to pay in early game, so pet investigation at the informer now costs 100gp.
* The increase in potential decrease [in 1.67] was a little too much, so all potential increases from training and items have been increased. The potential decrease remains the same.
* Like attribute potentials, potentials of all skills will now increase by 2% when waking up.
** Attribute potentials will also increase even more now.
** Characters will also gain a slight amount of attribute potentials depending on their class. This is on top of the existing feature where characters gain an amount of potential to random attributes that is proportional to the amount of gained experience.
** Also fixed the issue that caused potential increase to be different from the amount indicated. This issue was apparently introduced the previous time this code was modified.
** Potential increases for pets [after sleep] will also use this formula.
* Scrolls of ally will now auto-save and can no longer be used in show room.
* Souvenir vendors now sell scrolls of growth. This is for people who are drowning in money.
* When earned AP causes current AP to exceed the cap of 2000, the excess AP earned will decrease total AP. (This means that AP is no longer wasted when AP is at cap.)
* Items used for evolving pets are now affected by the rare loot trigger, and their base drop rate increased 2 to 5 times.
* When drunk, insanity received is halved and Sanity counter will increase by 1 less.
* Lulwy will now accept arrows and bolts as offerings.
* Ehekatl will now accept dead fish as offerings.
* Changed the effect of Objet of heart. It can now target an adjacent character to bring up a list of its elemental weaknesses and status ailments that it is not immune to, as well as other information such as the ability to float or see invisible monsters. It was previously used to [grant] special actions that the player was eligible to learn after leveling up.
* Seminars at the Adventure Seminar that have been completed and their item reward given will now cost 50gp to distinguish them from seminars that haven't been completed yet.
* Added a new item that is awarded when all item rewards at the Adventure Seminar have been given.
* The rate of obtaining bronze coins is apparently high enough, so Garok's services now cost bronze coins.
* Halved the number of small medals required to purchase a Garok's hammer. It will now add equipment attributes to equipment, with the attribute added depending on the equipment type. All of these attributes are ones will never be found naturally on the equipment type.
* Increased the grand prize for small gamble chests, with the chance of winning it remaining the same. Added a chance of winning smaller prizes. Increased the amount of Lock Picking they train. A sound effect is played and a message will be displayed when winning them. However, there is no chance of winning if the rare loot trigger is off.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some descriptions.
* Fixed the crash that sometimes occurred when determining the element of Variable Breath and Extermination Breath special actions.
* Visitors to your home and Fron the tour planner are no longer marked as summoned NPCs. They now have a different bit flag that causes them to despawn after some time.
* Fixed Over Long Throw special action not displaying what item was used to attack, except when an extra ranged attack procs, in which case the item name for the previous attack would get displayed.


==1.67fix3 (experimental build)==
'''5/5/2017'''
This is a version to test the new faster save file loading method.
Use this only if you know what you're doing, and make a backup of save files used with this version.
 [Changes and additions]
* Implemented quicker save file loading based the guide that was given. If the game crashes after doing something in particular, or if you find that certain game data doesn't get saved, then please do let me know. I may have missed something.

 [Fix]
* Fixed <Dokuro-Mikaduki> being considered a junk item because of a mistake made in Excel.


==1.67fix2==
'''5/2/2017'''
 [Changes and additions]
* You can now give instruments to any pet that has the Performing skill.
* The alternative Japanese name for robe and pope robe were both "robe", so the alternative name for the latter has been changed to "garb". (NB: does not affect the English version.)
* Added a random Nefia generation pattern that produces Nefia of a danger level that is 0.9 to 1.1 times that of the lowest dungeon floor beaten.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed skill selection getting skipped if a custom class name is not entered when creating a new character.
* Fixed region price modifiers for trade goods becoming 0 if you look at the trader's shop inventory then restart the game.
* Fixed the issue with the spell writer's shop inventory.


==1.67fix==
'''4/29/2017'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Increased the number of seeds that the cute fairy pukes out but limited it to once a day. The seeds will also always be generated uncursed and unblessed. Fixed a mistake in the date settings.
* The skill level and attribute reduction [service] added in 1.67 has been changed. The lower limit for Speed remains 50, but all other stats have a new lower limit of 20. The character level minimum is now 10. Luck attribute is no longer decreased.
* The range in reduction of potentials and their lower limit when attributes get increased by a fixed value (NB: probably from things like quaffing wells) is now the same as when attributes level up due to gained experience. Fixed-value attribute increases are now able to increase attributes even when potential is 0%.
* Unblessed potions of potential now increase 5 times the potential. There probably aren't that many people who quaff them unblessed, but just in case.
* When the target item of a quest is a generic wild flower, the quest description will now use the term "wild flower", which is the name of the item when unidentified. They can now be sold in your shop even though they are furniture items.
* The auto-save for the periodical shop inventory refresh has been changed to when talking to the shopkeepers. (Wizard mode is exempt from this auto-save.) Spell writers will also no longer cause an auto-save. This is because shop inventoriees weren't saving until players re-entered the map, and spell writers sometimes caused a crash.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some descriptions.
* Fixed craft repair kit making items black. They were dyed for debug purposes and I forgot to revert it.
* Fixed '*'s disappearing and skills displaying twice on the special action selection screen and when going back to it after selecting feats when creating a character. Special action selection has been moved so that it's after class selection.
* Fixed wizard mode not getting exempted from new auto-saves added.
* Fixed the auto-save for black cat equipment licking occurring before the item drops.
* Fixed equipment attribute power not getting properly calculated for living weapons in artifact fusion.
* Fixed items with [no value] being affected by price modifiers.
* Fixed items with sprite ID greater than 1000 causing a frame shift in the sprites for list of heirlooms in your home.
* Fixed an NPC added in 1.67 getting marked as non-evolving if it has not evolved yet. Also fixed a frameshift in deck sprites because of a missing check for sprite IDs greater than 1000.
* Fixed cards for characters that have been marked as having sprite ID greater than 1000 not getting sorted by No. and just getting tacked on to the end.


==1.67==
'''4/25/2017'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added Act III main quest content up to the Tezcatlipoca battle.
* Added 6 new beetle race NPCs. Added 1 new evolution.
* Added 3 new NPCs and 1 unique artifact for Act III.
* Added 2 new special actions. One of these is for NPC use only.
* Rebalanced SP cost of some special actions based on their usefulness instead of their frequency of use.
* Added a service in a South Tyris location that decreases the player's and pets' attributes and skill levels. INIT will be recalculated after the decrease. Use this if you want to decrease INIT of characters that were generated at high level. With this, you can decide between using strong [pets] as they are and raising weaker ones.
* Characters will receive bonus experience for all types of experience when conditions are met. The lower their INIT, the more they will receive.
* The game will now keep track of the number of days of experience a pet has had being shopkeeper in your shop. Days on which nothing was sold will not be counted. This counter can be viewed on the house board or a register. In the future, a feat may be conferred if this counter reaches a value.
* Increased the decrease in potential when attributes, spells, and skills level up. Set the lower bound of potential to 0%. Increased the increase in potential caused by all types of training, sleep, potions of potential, and large picnic baskets. Potential changes from breakfast event, scrolls of growth, and bonus points remain the same.
* Changed the special training in the Doujou from recovering 200 random potentials of one character to increasing all attribute and skill potentials of the target character by a set amount. This means that like regular training, having useless skills on your pet will not be a waste. There will also be a discount based on the number of pets currently training in the Doujou.
* The rare loot trigger added in 1.66 will now [be turned off] if the game is loaded while less than 10 minutes have passed since the previous load. It will also not turn off after a rare drop is generated. If 10 or more minutes have passed since the previous load, then it will turn on when you load the game again or change maps. If using a save game from before 1.67, it will be off to begin with because the playtime counter won't have anything in it.
* Wish occurrence rate from quaffing wells has been quintupled, and is also affected by the aforementioned trigger.
* Spawn rate of living weapons has been quintupled, and is also affected by the aforementioned trigger.
* Living weapons will now come with one Godly-class equipment attribute even if they are only of Miracle level. However, the level of the attribute will be slightly lower than that on a Godly piece of equipment.
** The number of choices of equipment attributes displayed remains 8, but each of them will now increase [enhance] level by +4 instead of +2.
** They are also no longer usable in artifact fusion, and significant changes have been made to the increases in equipment attribute levels.
** There is a set pattern which will determine what equipment attribute is conferred to the weapon.
** Furthermore, measures have been introduced to ensure that living weapons gain the bloodsucking attribute when they level up when they already have the maximum number of equipment attributes.
* The game will now also auto-save when moving between floors of the same map.
* Removed game loading with the F2 key (which was originally a debug mode feature). Saving with the F1 key remains, because without it players would have to close the game or trigger auto-save.
* Changed the effect of scrolls of inferior material, change material, and superior material. These scrolls will cycle through their respective lists of material one by one.
** If the material of the target item is not in the list of material for that particular scroll, then the scroll will start from the beginning of the list.
** If the material of the target item is in the list, then the scroll will change the material to the next one in its list.
** There are some materials in the list that will be skipped unless the scroll is blessed.
** Furniture will also no longer become wooden when certain light materials are picked.
* Quintupled the spawn rate of material kits (i.e. it is now 1/4 that of a scroll of superior material). Spawn rate is not affected by the aforementioned rare drop trigger.
* When using a Garok's hammer to change materials, you can now pick desired material from a list of a few candidate materials. Materials available in this list changes from day to day.
* Ammos can now be enhanced with scrolls of enchant weapon/blacksmiths.
* Buffed the jack lantern's effect.
* Implemented an item that can maximize the stats of a piece of equipment within its allowed range. It spawns as frequently as empty bottles and first aid kits.
* Added a new throwing item.
* Added a new item craftable with item fusion.
* Added a new item that acts as a new resource. This will be used for things that would be too expensive if they cost platinum pieces or small medals, but shouldn't be buyable with gold pieces.
* Added a new item that generates flowers in the wilderness, with the type of flower depending on the month. It is available from unknown seed crops.
* Added an item that allows you to obtain the figure of a target without killing it. However, it will cause the target to become hostile immediately unless the target is a pet. This is useful for obtaining the figures of NPCs that don't spawn as enemies.
* Added a new item. Rerolling [duplicates of] unique artifact equipment will turn them into this item instead of becoming a random artifact. This is to prevent the rerolling of artifacts over and over again to yield unusually good equipment that are not be normally obtainable.
* Made the message displayed when conditions for astral light pen usage aren't met more detailed. [Astral pen copies of NPCs] will now have the same age, height, weight, and faith as the original.
* Astral light pens are now usable on undead summoned by necromancy. This is for people who have grown really fond of their zombies. Their level relative to the player as well as ink consumption will be calculated with the level of the [original NPC found in the wild]. Necro tuning effects will not be carried over, [except for] changes to their appearance made [by Necro tuning with figures and cards]. Their level will be that of [the original NPC].
* Astral light pens are now usable on fused undead. This is for people who want to have them as pets. The level requirement and ink consumption will use the level of the original NPC + 100. The level of the astral copy will also be that of the original NPC, but they are undeadgods so they will get weakened.
* Trismagistus and violent skull sword are now usable as materials in their respective recipes. This means that you can upgrade low-level items that were crafted [when your skill levels were lower].
* Added a new equipment attribute and a character bit flag that works like quick-draw, allowing characters to counter ranged attacks they receive before the actual attack [hits].
* Statue of Yacatect now gives platinum pieces and small medals when the date changes [instead of using a cooldown].
* Statue of Kumiromi gives 3 seeds every time. The type of seed varies depending on the day.
* Cute fairy gives 3 seeds every time. The type of seed varies depending on the day.
* Increased chance that the black cat adds an equipment attribute, and the game will auto-save when doing so. It's a servant of Ehekatl, so this will depend on your real-life luck.
* The game will auto-save when opening a monster ball.
* Halved the chance of getting attacked by assassins as well as the number of enemies that appear in those attacks during escort quests. The game will auto-save when an attack occurs.
* Gavela now lets you add the body part of your choice instead of a random part. The amount of Life taken away depends on the body part added.
* Added a modifier for number of items stocked and maximum number of items available in NPC shops. This modifier depends on the base number of items the shop sells and their invest level. Shop inventories no longer refresh when you talk to the shopkeeper. Instead, all shops on the map will refresh when you enter the map.
* Quadrupled the spawn rate of flying scrolls.
* Increased the number of items that get generated on the ground in Nefias.
* Removed the low chance that eating an egg will give the same effect as eating the corpse of the NPC that had laid it.
* Corpses that have a chance of granting elemental resistances when eaten now give half the resistance but 100% of the time. The message log will display the increase in resistance only for [every second corpse] eaten.
* Halved the resistances gained from eating yith-yaki, and changed the chance of gaining resistance from 20% to 100%. The message log will display the increase in resistance only for [every second corpse] eaten. Increased the insanity that they cause as they are readily available from shops.
* Item drop rate from defeating characters that have the summoned bit flag has been changed from 20% to 0%.
* Equipment on enemies in Nefia will now have a chance of being +enhanced only if it is of miracle or godly quality. Miracle and godly equipment that are +enhanced will now always drop, so you no longer have to pick up all drops, nor keep farming them until they do.
* Slightly reduced the effect of +enhance value on the price of food and equipment.
* Cooking will now yield one more product when Cooking skill is level 100 and above, and another when level 200 and above. The effect of the ingredient will remain, but the effects of herbs mixed into the ingredient will be lost.
* Increased the number of jerky pieces produced by 5 times. Satiety that they recover is now 60% of what the value used to be.
* Approximate difficulty of spellbook reading is now displayed in the description of spellbooks. This is just a ballpark figure so that you can roughly know which ones you can read instead of getting surprised by their difficulty.
* When you do not have any pet slots free, the game will tell you that when offering the choice of whether you want to take a certain puppy or extraterrestrial with you. That means you no longer have to wonder why you can't bring them with you even after talking to them.
* Redesigning your home and moving stayers will now take 1 turn.
* Adventurers will no longer be hostile to you when they return [from the hospital] after getting defeated in a duel.
* You can now hand over instrument-type items to pets who have performer-type AIs.
* Changed some descriptions.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed gold pieces for defeating Nefia bosses getting spawned at a random coordinate on the same map.
* Fixed the "Loyter or vanity" Party Time! spawning rule not working.
* Fixed Ensemble effect ending when an NPC's performance ends while Ensemble is ongoing.
* Fixed the AIs of several characters who were supposed to use regular attacks in combination with their other moves but didn't use them at all.

'''3/12/2017'''
 [Changes and additions]
* The armour equipped by NPCs will now be +enhanced depending on their starting level like their weapon currently is. This will not apply to summoned NPCs and NPCs outside Nefias though.
* Equipment increase in price with their +enhance value. Enhanced equipment have the same chance of dropping [from kills] as miracle-quality equipment. The chance for enhanced miracle equipment to drop is even higher. Be sure to leave some space in your inventory so that you can pick these equipment up.
* Reduced the multiplier on sales at player shops specialized in equipment from 2 times to 1.5 times.
* Greatly reduced the delay between refresh ticks for generating fertilizer on farms and well as the Rubbing and milking cooldowns on the ranch from 120 hours to 24 hours. For existing saves, the new cooldown will take effect after the next fertilizer generation/Rubbing/milking. There is still the minimum 24 hours delay between crop growth [ticks] and generation/breeding of ranch animals. However, the number of chances that crops get to grow over a period of a few days has been doubled, and the chance of ranch animal breeding/produce spawning has been quadrupled.
* Amount of money rewarded for clearing Nefias (and their individual floors) was way too much, so it has been significantly reduced.
* Added just a few pieces of info that the tutorial facility was lacking.
* Added 1 new unique NPC in the tutorial facility who will give you an item if you meet the requirement.
* Slightly reduced the fee for attending the Seminar. This is as low as it will go so that players will pay attention to the content.
* Changed the portraits of 4 unique NPCs added in 1.65. Middle-age wizards are kind of hard to draw...
* Added 2 new red books.
* Made categories of instruments produce different "" [speech bubbles]. Some of them were kind of hard to illustrate as text, so these might change in the future.
* Performing and harvesting quests will now automatically end if you leave the map. (The quests will be cleared if you meet the quotas.) Added an exit for the Party Time! map at the bottom.
* Changed appearance rates and added more unique NPCs to the list that will appear in Party Time!. There is now a difference between North and South Tyris in terms of the NPCs that will appear, and people who shouldn't be together will no longer appear at the same location.
* Greatly increased the chance of satisfying the audience when Fascination Dance succeeds.
* Preaching special action will now please the audience and award points.
* When characters with the spell multi-casting bit flag defeat an enemy with dart-type spells, they will no longer immediately search for the next target and shoot the remaining dart spells at it.
* Disturbance special action no longer activates when used on a target that does not use gauge attacks. The animation has also been sped up, and the log will describe who used Disturbance on which target.
* Made some South Tyris towns have more/less of certain types of quests.
* Digging town walls will yield gold bars as well as gold pieces.
* Reduce the amount of nutrition that the goose needs to lay platinum pieces. Yacatect's gem stone now gives 10-25pp (depending on Faith skill level).
* Increased the limit on number of handmade chocolate that you can make [per year] from 3 to 10. However, they no longer heal, and their effect on Impress has been reduced.
* Pets being ridden will now have their HP bar colour change when they are not hungry.
* Rod of alchemy and energy crystal of matrix no longer work on items marked as important.
* When NPCs attempt to use Shadow Step, Run Wildly, ZinlaiKyaku, or Clash Rush on a target out of sight, it will now become a regular movement instead of attack.
* Changed the colour of some wall tiles in the Act III main dungeon.
* The log now displays if bomb rocks are idling or in combat, so keep an eye on it. Cluster bomb rock also no longer uses Draw Shadow, and will approach its target with regular movement. As such, they are no longer something that you have to prepare for in advance and are now quite avoidable.
* Eye of brainwashing special action now has a visual effect only when the target fails to resist. If the target is the player, the attribute used to resist is now Will instead of Charisma. If the target is an NPC, (Impress + player's Charisma) will be rolled against (50 + attacker's Charisma) to resist.
* There is a feature in vanilla Elona where breath attacks do not work on tiles outside a radius centred on the player. This means that all breath attacks outside used to be just a wasted [turn]. This has been changed so that breath attacks will work outside that radius.
* The equipment that NPCs spawn with and rare drops that have a 1/100 chance of getting generated or less now have 5-20 times the rate of getting generated. However, there is a trigger that decides if they will get generated, and this has a 1/4 chance of being turned on at the start of each day. Once [a rare piece of artifact equipment or rare drop] spawns, this trigger is turned off. These items will never drop/spawn when the trigger is off.
* <Oti-Tubaki>, <Hero's cloak>, plank of Carneades, and <Nightmare> will now get randomly generated. They are unaffected by the aforementioned trigger.
* The <Stradivarius> is now available for purchase with music tickets.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some descriptions.
* Fixed the log not describing who used a breath attack for breath attacks used within sight.
* Fixed an NPC added in 1.65 not being marked as unique, causing it to get randomly generated and not speak its unique NPC lines. If this NPC is already generated in a save file from a previous version, the game will automatically mark it as unique when you enter the border map.
* Fixed the deck image of an NPC added in 1.65 (not the aforementioned).
* Fixed sprites for female chickens not getting used.
* Fixed exchange items (NB: music tickets/small medals?) in player shops not getting categorized as sellable items.
* Fixed vomiting when Alchemical Rain is use and generating a vomit causing the current Alchemical Rain to apply the blessed/cursed status of the vomit [to the remaining hits].
* Fixed getting hit by cut damage counter when using Distant Attack adjacent to the target.
* Fixed custom dungeon deed map name getting reset to the default when you exit the map by walking off the map edges.
* Fixed challenge-type hunting quests not getting cleared after defeating the quest target if the same type of monster has been summoned (by necromancy or otherwise) on the map.


==1.65==
'''2/13/2017'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added a bit of Act III main quest content.
* When the informer NPC has been informed of your birthday and that day is today, a birthday event will occur when changing maps. (It will only occur once a year.) It's nothing much, so please don't be too eager to see it.
* Added a tutorial facility and 6 new NPCs a short distance south of Vernis. This is to guide players through the early game where it is easy to mess up. It will appear after a diastrophism if you're using a save from a previous version. This is oriented towards totally new players. If beginners find themselves getting stuck in the game even after following the hints given, then I might want to add more tutorial content or change game balance.
* Changed the chicken NPC's sprite because it's the year of the rooster. Also made a different sprite for female chickens.
* Placed a new unique NPC at the South Tyris north border.
* Added 2 new spirit NPCs and evolution patterns.
* 2 new red books. Placed one of them permanently on a map.
* Livestock can now be milked by using Squeeze special action on them.
** Milk obtained this way will have an +enhance value on them that depends on how much they were brushed and the player's Dexterity.
** Milk sells for the same amount for all monsters, so with some Rubbing you could have a dairy farm even on a ranch with low level monsters.
* To make PV less important and accuracy less unimportant, DV now has 1.75 times the effect on evasion compared to previous versions.
* Nerfed Violent Garden - its bind has been reduced to 1 turn.
* Some random Nefia will now be generated with their danger level dependent on the lowest floor cleared plus the level modifier of the respective areas.
* Slicing animation for bladed weapons now play rotated to a random angle.
* Gauge attacks will no longer proc while Continuous attacks special action is in use. Also made the latter's animation faster, and if the attack is a blunt force the animation will be played at random coordinates. Increased the damage multiplier from 17/15 to 17/6. However, there is now a 70% chance that no experience will be gained when attacking.
* Accuracy is now halved when attacking with Shadow Step special action. Shadow Step will now become a regular attack when used by NPCs on a target adjacent to them.
* Users of Distant Attack will no longer get hit by things like cut damage counter when using that attack from a distance.
* Doubled the effectiveness of "increases your chance/decreases enemy chance to deliver critical hits" equipment attributes and Eye of Mind skill. Halved the critical chance penalty of heavy weapons.
* Desert regions no longer confuse the player, and will instead cause mild Dim and deal low amounts of damage.
* Pets can now be made to stay on a certain floor at your home. They will no longer attempt to follow you to other floors, and their default position will be fixed at the coordinate designated. After updating the game, you will have to redesignate pets as stayers at your home.
* Onigiri now takes 2 turns to eat. (Note that other foods take 9 turns.) This means that if they have an +enhance value on them they can be used to recover SP even while in combat.
* Added the cooked food rank to item names.
* Added bed rank to the descriptions of beds.
* Reduced identification fee. Investigating pets still costs the same.

 [Fixes]
* When neutral NPCs in random Nefia trigger a randomly-generated wire trap that they will no longer behave as if the player had attacked them.
* Fixed Silent Ocean special action not changing some tiles. (Music tiles will [still] be unchanged by it.)
* Fixed an oversight in BGM assigning for F10 and onwards in the Cradle of Chaos.
* Fixed the 16th adventurer getting recognized as a pet by certain game functions such as duel gloves and red soul spindle.
* Starvation damage will no longer occur while a picnic basket is in use.
* Fixed Misteltein special action not being considered a hostile action.
* Made Graviton Buster not proc from Gravity Sphere equipment attribute.
* Reduced [multiplier on] MP-dependent portion of MP Breath from 50% to 25%.


==1.64==
'''12/18/2016'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added 2 floors of content to the main quest.
* Added an item that is available for a limited time only. If you update the game while it is still 2016 and load a save file, it will be generated at your feet.
* Made some changes to moon gates and runes because of the server shutdown.
* Added 6 high-level ent race NPCs.
* Ent race NPCs will start with Gardening skill.
* Added 2 new evolutions.
* Added 3 new special actions. Added 1 new feat that grants them.
* The number of gold pieces awarded for clearing random Nefia is now approximately 1/4 of what it was. Floors other than the first one will have roughly the same amount of gold placed on the ground. This change was made because dungeons gave the same reward no matter how many floors there were in there, and players looking to get the gold reward at the end were basically making a beeline for the last floor. This should increase the amount of money Nefias award if they have 5 floors or more.
* Tiles in the random floors of the Act III main quest dungeon are now of a certain type. This does not affect floors that already have been generated.
* Decreased the spawn rate of Nefias that have a danger level that depends on the lowest floor cleared.
* The player can now use Pregnant special action when pregnant. Now you can get that girl/guy you like knocked up. The kid isn't going to be yours though! (Talk about high-level NTR shenanigans.)
* NPCs born from pregnancy will have a level of at most 200.
* Increased amount of exp gained by students at the Doujou when the player stops by.
* Changed the power of Gravity Sphere special action. Its power was previously balanced with end-game Constitution in mind, so this time it should be balanced when Constitution is still low. Floor number also has a lower effect on its power now.
* Converge Breath gauge attack will now increase current HP by 1/3. This increases HP, but is not a healing move. It may increase HP beyond the maximum until HP gets recalculated. HP will not be increased if current HP already exceeds maximum HP.
* Items made from item fusion will be identified when created.
* Increased the base price of items created from wood craft and stone craft item fusion recipes. Carpentry and Jeweler skills modifier on item quality has been adjusted so that they make it easier to craft better items. The material of the resulting item is also no longer fixed and is now random, so items may sell for even more due to the material modifier on their prices. However, the game will auto-save after crafting an item.
* Decreased the skill level required for emerald tablet, brilliant rubynus, and brilliant diamond item fusion recipes. Increased the sell price of those items. Number of items consumed when crafting remains the same.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some descriptions.
* Fixed and added content to help_npc.txt.
* Changed now CNPCs act when they select a move from their routine which CNPCs are not supposed to use. They will now use a physical attack instead.
* Fixed the colour mix-up for the archayeek and lunatyeek monsters.
* Fixed cancelling item fusion after the ingredients have already been selected then using another item fusion recipe consuming the ingredients from the cancelled recipe.
* Fixed gender displaying twice on the conversation windows.
* Fixed the issue with trismagistus attack range.
* Fixed being able to use Fire a volley even if gauge is below 50%.
* Fixed Converge Breath stopping time even when gauge is 100%.
* Fixed Giga Gravitation affecting targets out of sight. Also fixed the debug sound effect getting played; it was used for checking when Magic Capacity experience was obtained. Also fixed 10% of maximum HP getting consumed instead of 10% of maximum MP.
* Fixed Effect Speed option in the in-game config glitching when restarting the game.


==1.63==
'''11/4/2016'''
 [Changes and additions]
* 3 additional floors of main quest content.
* Added 1 unique NPC and 1 unique artifact for Act III.
* Added 6 new high-level behicle race NPCs.
* Added 1 new evolution and changed an existing one.
* Removed the DV halving effect of Mist of Frailness spell. Added an [armour] skill reduction effect that works separately from the PV halving effect. Armour skill reduction amount scales with spell level to a maximum of 300. The spell will also reduce the bonuses from armour skill. This is to make the spell useful for players and allies and not just for enemies.
* The Gravity status ailment now goes away when changing maps.
* Changed the damage calculation for Gravity Sphere special action. Base damage is now higher, floor number has less of an effect, and it is also no longer reduced by the target's Strength. It can still be reduced by magic resistance and Feather. It will now also roll to cause a short duration of Slow (can be resisted); duration of Slow depends on the user's Constitution. The probability that its corresponding equipment attribute will proc this special action has been reduced to 60%.
* Added a gauge attack that is activated by Gravity Sphere special action.
* Added 2 'W'ide special actions that work well with the Gravity spell. The Tough feats have been swapped for a feat that grants these. This should make it possible to roleplay as a character with gravity powers.
* Added a special action that allows you to run over enemies while riding.
* Added 1 learnable feat (i.e. not bought with AP) that reduces the accuracy penalty for riding.
* Minimum damage for Smash Ground and Blade Strings special actions after damage reduction now depends on the user's Strength and Tactics.
* Changed the counter for stacks of sox and panties [in the Japanese version] to pairs.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some descriptions.
* Fixed the following unique artifact melee weapons not triggering gauge attacks: Blood rod, Sasanqua Sickle, Zugaikurai, and Necromantis.
* Fixed using love potions with Alchemical Rain dripping hot wax from Candle of Luluwy on to targets.
* Fixed a turn getting expended if you use the Directive special action but cancel before selecting a target even if you have a Very pistol of Mani.
* Fixed there not being an accuracy penalty due to the weight for a ranged weapon equipped in a hand slot.
* Fixed there being an accuracy penalty due to weight for a melee weapon equipped in the ranged slot.
* Fixed having an extra sox taken from you when turning in sox at a particular Act III sub quest if you have 31 or more sox. (For example, if you had 60 sox when turning them in, you will end up with only 29.)
* All NPCs except ranch animals that have had a seasoning item used on them will no longer attempt to follow the player around.
* Fixed harvesting unknown seeds causing the artifact seed auto-save and their crops gaining +enchant value reserved for fruits and vegetables.
* Fixed Icolle's body part reset service not resetting largeanimal and seamonster race characters to their default set of parts.
* Fixed the crash that occurred when attempting to read more than a certain number of sprites within the deck. As a result of this change, user sprites (for custom NPCs) are now permanently set to their default.
* Fixed the freeze that occurred when using Golden Storm when there are no targets within range of the special action due to the continual searching for a valid target. As a precaution against this bug, the number of times targets will be attacked is now more random. To make up for that, 1 turn of irresistible Blind status ailment will be applied. Blind enemies with bling!


==1.62==
'''9/25/2016'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Overhauled character sprite drawing to make it possible to accommodate 1000+ sprites. Mostly affects custom NPCs and disguised summoned undead. As far as I can tell, everything should still work the same.
* If the move that an NPC picks from its AI routine is Hero, Holy Shield, Regeneration, Attribution Shield, Speed. Holy Veil, Divine Wisdom, Lulwy's Trick, Boost, Contingency, Clear Mind, Feather, Charge Attack, Attribute, AutoGuard (aka Absolute Protect), Retention (aka Space Retention), Concentration, Element Scar, Mist of Silence, Slow, [Mist of] Frailness, Nightmare, Punishment, or Death Word, and its target is already afflicted with the buff/debuff, it will attempt to pick another move out of the routine up to two times. For example, a move that has a 20% chance of getting used will now only have a 0.8% chance of getting wasted.
* Added a new gauge attack that procs from touch-type special actions.
* Added a 'W'ide special action that throws money. Money thrown cannot be recovered.
* Added 2 new special actions for NPC use only.
* Added 1 new 'W'ide special action available from the shield bash feat.
* Sacks of sugar and bottles of salt are now usable items. Added pepper and soy sauce items; these fall in the same category of items as the former two. Using these on any NPC will marinate them and increase the quality of the corpse they drop (up to +4). Now you can enjoy little Gwen with salt and pepper or have your bosses with soy sauce.
* Unknown seed crops no longer yield junk- and ore-type items.
* Tentatively added 4 new items. All of them are obtainable from unknown seeds.
* Added 3 new item fusion recipes. Relaxed item requirements for instant ale recipe and increased the number of products it yields.
* Summoned undead no longer contribute to performing score.
* Only one each of every type of fused undead can be created at a time.
* Coffins of necromancy of summoned undead used in necro fusion will now have a cooldown of 24 hours.
* Kaneda Bike's sprite is now a mix of the original bike that it references and a normal motorcycle.
* Using Alchemical Rain with love potions no longer causes impress to increase (it will still cause Dim though).
* Changed the damage calculation for Blade Strings. Tactics skill now has a greater effect on damage, and damage is now reduced by the target's armour skill.
* The "change attack to arrow magic" feat now gives Casting experience. Special actions that proc regular attacks will now also change those attacks to dart-type spells.
* The portion of the extra melee attack bonus chance that depends on the number of hands is now 0 when number of hands is 2 or fewer. (NB: see equipment attributes page on English wiki for more info.)
* I've always felt that Confused and Dim are too similar in terms of their effects, and there are also several ways of applying Dim to targets that are immune to it. Thus, to make the distinction between them greater, Confused now causes only spellcasting failure and random movement of the player's character, and also reduced ability to give commands to the player's character. Dim, on the other hand, causes reduced accuracy, reduced evade, and an increased chance of receiving critical attacks.
* Body weight of 100kg and above no longer grants immunity to spider webs.
* The portion of body weight that depends on height has a minimum of 0. Characters with 0 weight now no longer gains weight when eating. Cursed Slow potions and that soup item will still have an effect.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some descriptions.
* Fixed tobacco not getting consumed in the tobacco processing recipe.
* Fixed damage reduction due to distance multipliers getting applied twice when rock throwing equipment attribute is in effect.
* Fixed regular investing (i.e. not investing 50) attempting to increase shop rank twice.
* Fixed portrait, name, and atmosphere of characters that do not have a walking animation set not returning to their normal state when the effect of a shift core ends.
* Fixed log messages sometimes not getting displayed when more than one message attempts to display when changing maps.


==1.61==
'''8/18/2016'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Four floors' worth of content in Act III main quest.
* Added 2 new items.
* Added 1 new precious artifact. It will cause summoned undead to fuse with one another.
* Added 4 new low-level undeadgod NPCs. They do not spawn naturally.
* Added 1 new unique NPC for Act III.
* Increased the volume of the growling sound effect when entering a floor with a Big Daddy.
* The effect of changing physical attacks to dart spells is no longer solely applied to actions in the NPC's AI routine. It will now also work even if the target is out of range for that particular action in the routine to activate and the NPC ends up doing a regular attack.
* Added 2 new 'W'ide special actions obtainable from the Gentle Face feat.
* Added 1 new 'W'ide special action obtainable from the Magic Eye feat.
* Number of turns that targets are boosted by Rubbing special action is now 3 and 5 respectively for Fellow impress and for Soul Mate and above.
* Changed the name of Resolution Hand special action, and also made slight changes to its cost and effect.
* Sound effect for Blade Turbulence special action no longer plays when the user is out of the player's sight.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some descriptions.
* Added code to dissolve a tag team if a tag member has been handed over for a sub quest or placed in the Doujou. This is to prevent the remaining member of the team from temporarily vanishing.
* Fixed experience getting rewarded for using Blade Strings on NPCs resulting from splitting or on a sandbag.
* Fixed the conversation continuing normally and the game crashing sometimes if a pet is selected from the list pets to change martial style for at the Doujou, and then cancelled.


==1.60fix==
'''7/18/2016'''
 [Fixes]
* Fixed the crash that sometimes occurs when selling items or depositing items while affected by buffs or debuffs.
* Fixed level 0 spells getting displayed on the character sheet's list.


==1.60==
'''7/18/2016'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added 6 high-level yeek race NPCs.
* Added 1 item fusion recipe.
* Reduced the SP cost of "Touch of..."-type special actions. Added a Wide-area support special action for those.
* While Sense Objects is active, you will be able to see invisible NPCs as well now.
* Individual spells can now be tracked, the decimal values of their spell levels can be seen, and bonus points can now be spent on them on the character sheet after the resistances section. (Some debug mode functions have been enabled to allow this.)
* Added an AP feat for pet use only (listed under Change battle style). When they attempt to use a regular physical attack (melee or ranged), it will become a dart-type spell of the element that they have the highest resistance against.
* Reduced the cost of magic practice to 3-10 pp.
* The goose now lays 2 pp at a time.
* The Elements Eyes artifact no longer affects all allied characters in visual range, and is now targeted in the 4 cardinal directions. Its effects also no longer wear off during sleep. By targeting the desired character and selecting the Cancel option, the Elements Eyes' effect will wear off on that character.
* There is now a confirmation dialogue when handing over town child NPCs at an Act II sub quest. Pets marked as important can no longer be handed over.
* Pets' Investing skill now has some effect when the player is investing shop (the sum of 1/5 of each of their Investing skill capped at the player's Investing skill level). They will also receive experience to the skill.
* Rare herbs now recover 20 times as much potential. The amount of potential recovered by food infused with herb remains the same. This is to buff the option of eating herbs as they are.
* Magic practice experience now increases with Learning attribute instead of being a fixed value.
* Added scroll of escape to rewards given for defeating the random boss in dungeons.
* The speed at which effect animations play at can now be adjusted in the in-game settings.
* You can now tell the informer your birthday once. There may be a birthday event in future versions that will occur on the real-life date.
* Made it possible to have even more physical intimacy with your pet:
** It is now possible to access a special conversation screen with pets who are at Friend impress or above. Choosing which action to take will expend action points.
** TxtDialogB, TxtDialogE, TxtDialogF, and TxtDialogH from the pet's custom spoken line file will be used by depending on which action you choose to take, and they will also change their full-body portrait (NB: AKA 'atmosphere') to match.
** Their happiness will increase depending on the actions taken up to a maximum of 10. Sleeping will reset your action points to 10, but all happiness points of all pets will also be reset.
** Pets' gauges will increase by their happiness points every time they take a turn.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some descriptions.
* Fixed the crash that occurred if you enter a number less than 0 or a number for which no picture file exists when changing the atmosphere (the full-body portrait). To prevent this, numbers that do not match any picture file can no longer be selected. (This also means that you will be unable to select pictures if their file numbers are not contiguous.)
* Fixed the enhances your spells modifier only being 1.1 times at most for magic devices due to a typo.
* Fixed the massive reduction in healing effect on characters with cMetal and cArmour bit flags.
* Fixed being able to repatriate inner gods recruited as pets, causing them to disappear.
* Added more measures to prevent sell price overflow.
* Fixed Time Stop special action having an effect even when time has already been stopped. Also fixed some characters not getting their gauge reduced when they use it.


==1.59==
'''6/18/2016'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added 3 floors of content to Act III main quest.
* 300x500 full-body portraits (black is transparent) can now be selected for pets in their respective conversation windows. Another portrait can be designated for Form Shift.
** You can have 4 different versions of the full-body portrait, and which portrait gets displayed depends on the situation. It takes a lot of effort to make different versions of a portrait, so it's possible that I won't create any more conditions.
** This is to strengthen the feeling of having a loyal partner throughout your adventures.
** I'd like to create something else in the future that also uses these portraits.
** Details on how to use it can be found in help.txt in the user folder because it's rather lengthy.
* Sense Object no longer lasts for 2 seconds, but instead lasts until you press the enter or space keys. Now you can look for all you like, and it will also work if anime_wait is 0. Take a look at the [words at the] bottom right of the window before worrying about why everything is frozen.
* Tentatively added a new facility to the Act III continent.
* Added 3 unique NPCs for Act III.
* Added 1 unique artifact.
* Added 4 high-level quicklings. They are all unique in their own way.
* Changed the sprite for quicklings so that they face to the front because it was hard to tell whether it was a face or a hand on the old sprite. You can now tell that they are a type of dwarf.
* Changed the cMetal bit flag so that it only reduces regular physical attacks now. They usually get killed before they kill the player, so this should be reasonable.
* To be honest, I've always wondered if having the equivalent of 4 times the health and having armor that resists magic was too much, so cArmor bit flag has also been changed to reduce only regular physical attacks.
* Increased the attributes for armor race.
* Gave metalslug cMetal bit flag for real. Existing metalslugs will have their cArmor swapped for this when their stats are recalculated.
* Buffed starting magic resistance of metal race.
* When a spell levels up, its potential will decrease by a greater amount now. (Makes it harder to level spells by spamming them in a short window of time.)
* Spells can now be trained at wizards (the identifier) in towns. Each course will give a lot of experience to a different set of spells. (Wish and Harvest cannot be trained.) This does not consume any spell stock, so this makes it possible to train spells that are hard to obtain.
* Capped the enhances your spells equipment attribute effect at 2x. Equipment attribute strength will also be proportionally harder to increase (i.e. if you've already reached the cap now, then you'll still be at the cap after the update.)
* As Casting skill of NPCs increases, spell power will increase more now.
* Changed how an Act II sub quest increased Luck. If potential is below 300%, it increases potential by 80-100% at random. If it's 300% or above, then it gives Luck attribute experience.
* Yerleswood type M (the mass-produced model) now has a sprite that makes it look mass-produced. This does not affect existing NPCs.
* Added a new special action.
* Converge Breath damage now depends on Magic and not Magic Control skill.
* Added 2 red books.
* There will now be a coffin of necromancy and some other things in Lumiest graveyard.
* Prevented overflow when selling items.
* The conversation windows in cutscenes will no longer display impress, attract, and anniversary.
* Potions that are easily obtainable in large amounts like snow and dyes will no longer increase Alchemy and Magic Device. I was wondering if it should also apply to alcohols.
* Reduced quest points, experience, and gold gained from performing, preaching, and using Fascination Dance on summoned NPCs. They also no longer throw items at you.
* The chance of having a physical attack hit the target that is independent of the characters' statuses (i.e. lucky hits) now depends on the attacker's Luck attribute.
** NB: Probably the chance of landing a hit even with extremely low hit rate or if the target has extremely high evade.
* Number of gold pieces obtained from Mad Millionaire random event now increases with the player's Luck.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some descriptions.
* Upon closer inspection, item sales at the default player's shop had a 7/8 chance of getting cancelled, so the cancellation chance for specialized shops has been changed to 1/2.
* Made 4-Dimensional mirror unusable on the world map.
* Fixed some special actions being unable to target enemies who are barely in range.
* Fixed special abilities granted by non-AP feats getting displayed in the list when you change equipment after hiding them.
* When an adventurer has an item that is not a weapon equipped in his hands, it will now automatically get corrected.

'''5/8/2016'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Special actions can be hidden with the '*' key. It will still work while hidden, so you can still use it by pressing the shortcut key assigned to it. The '/' key will make all hidden special actions visible again, and works separately for the special actions and wide actions tabs.
* Increased player's range of sight by 1 tile.
* Sense Objects now has the additional effect of allowing you to see through walls and doors for 2 seconds. Now you will know what lies ahead, and any terrain that was revealed during this will remain unshrouded. Can't say that this is an inferior version of Magic Map any more, can you? Use it to gain an advantage before heading into dungeon rooms or when there are a lot of obstacles.
** NB: Will not work in 1.58 if anime_wait in config.txt is "0".
* 2 floors worth of new content in Act III main quest.
* 3 new high-level NPCs for each of the Elea and Zanan races.
* Added 2 new unique artifacts.
* Added an item for changing height, and another for weight.
* nurse, <Mad scientist>, <Icolle>, and <Mary> will start off with Gene engineer skill.
* Changed nurse sprite.
* Act I last boss's sprite has been altered to matched his portrait.
* Added an intermediary sprite for older wolf sister (NB: evolved older dog sister). (This will not affect characters that have already been evolved.)
* Equipment attributes on godly equipment are now one step stronger.
* Artifact staves will no longer gain random magic-type equipment attributes.
* Stones (including Vanilla Rock) now have an equipment attribute that increases Throwing skill. Behold, the true power of rock throwing.
* Magic ammos used to cause damage of a random element; it will now also cause the attack to be a critical hit.
* Shopkeepers in your shop can be made to gain a large amount of potential of their Negotiation skill and Charisma attribute. Reinstated 1/32 chance of cancelling a sale for specialized shops on second thought.
* Failing a certain sub quest the first time will allow you to receive the reward the second time you complete it. If you already have the artifact, it will still be rewarded the during the first completion of the quest after upgrading to this version.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some descriptions.
* Fixed being able to show your cards even without a deck in a sub quest.
* Fixed crash resulting from using eye-type gauge attack. (This is not the same fix as the previous version.)
* Fixed experience received when attacking with Blade Strings special action being off by a factor of 10.


==1.57==
'''4/18/2016'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Made it possible to name your deeds with a house board or a register, except your house and the maid mansion. The name will then be displayed on the bottom left just like your house. It will also show up if it's a showroom map.
* The type of shop that you own can be changed. It's similar to expanding the shop in that it will cost money. Items that are not compatible with the shop type will not sell at all, but compatible items will sell for more, and sell more quickly. For example, food shops will sell food items very easily. This and the above change make roleplaying a shopkeeper much easier - not that this was the reason for the change.
* Cold damage deals more damage on wet targets. The multiplier is higher than the one for lightning damage.
* Precious equipment will no longer come with random equipment attributes. To make up for that, made godly equipment come with more attributes.
* Doing melee attacks when equipped with a shield will give Shield skill experience.
* Reduced shield casting penalty from 12% to 5%.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some descriptions.
* Made it possible to wish for secret characters in the English version.
** NB: "secretcharacter"
* Fixed English map name for Harvest Time quests.
* Fixed 1.56 unique NPC having a higher level than it should due to the Cradle of Chaos bonus.
* Fixed characters equipped with nothing causing a crash with an error when they used certain gauge attacks.
* Fixed repeatedly using Multiple Gather causing a crash with an error.



==1.56==
'''4/10/2016'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Five additional floors worth of main quest in Act III.
* Added 6 high-level members to the Shell race including 1 unique NPC. Added 1 evolution pattern.
* Added one new artifact and unique NPC.
* Added 2 special actions. Made the detection-type feats grant a special action instead.
* Added two gaze-type special actions. Added a feat that will confer one of them.
* Added gauge attacks that trigger with gaze-type attacks other than Eye of brainwashing.
* Modified medusa, euryale, stheno, and cockatrice's AIs. Only the newly-generated NPCs will experience this change.
* Worshipping changes:
** Doubled the effect of the passive ability from worshipping Mani.
** The ability from Opatos has been made to affect more than physical damage.
** Yacatect's ability will now also increase the drop rate of regular items.
** Speed increase and speed cap for worshipping Lulwy also increased.
** 20% of max health added to formula for Prayer of Jure, but only for the player.
** Made stamina regeneration from worshipping Kumiromi recover 1 sp/2 turns.
* Changed stamina recovery from 2 sp/10 turns to 2 sp/4 turns.
* Made it so that Mist of Silence effect will not show up even when out of sight.
* Changed mana battery calculation. Spells levels won't be 0, increased the amount of spell stock gained, and made it display what stock was gained or if mana was recovered.
* Changed harpy race's second leg slot to a back slot.
* When the sum of "chance of extra ranged/melee attack"	equipment attributes and the bonus from Dual Wield skill reaches a certain amount, extra attacks become guaranteed. Changed it to make the extra attacks somewhat random.
* Added a sound effect that plays when entering a floor with a Big Daddy in it.
* Prevented empty items from showing up in the list of things to (o)pen. You can now open containers by spamming the shortcut key assigned to them.
* Dyes will now have their colour code after their name to help differentiate between similar colours. (It will not display when unidentified.)
* magistus, trismagistus, skull sword, and violent skull sword will display the skill level at which they were made.
* When the player successfully uses the special action Bewitch on friendly NPCs, money will be received. They will not give any more money when they are no longer interested, and you receive less than if you had used prostitution. It's low-risk and low-return; it takes only 1 turn, the NPCs do not need to be drunk, and there is no risk of Sickness. It's for roleplaying a beggar, when you need money, and when you just want to siphon money off them but remain chaste.
* Summoned undead will no longer start sleeping in towns at night.
* Characters that die to fire damage will no longer start a fire. Items on the ground will still burn without a magatama.
* High level adventurers and god NPCs will have their attributes weakened to 1/5 instead of 1/6. This should fix the bug where the values were not rounded off properly, making the values go weird.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some descriptions.
* Fixed Shining Wave having a water sound effect.
* Fixed message displayed when stepping on essential oil and gasoline puddles. Gasoline puddles generated in a previous version will display as and act like essential oil though.
* Fixed a variable in alchemy rain not functioning as it should and causing bugged exp gain.
* Made a sub quest added in 1.55 recognize when the year changes.
** NB: Sophia's quest.
* Made duel opponents not capturable with monster balls and little balls.
* Made maximum HP/MP not overflow.
* Fixed critical hit damage multiplier using Martial Arts not going above 1.
* Extra attacks should proc less the more arms the character has - the modifier wasn't working, and it's fixed now.
* Fixed the bonus skill selected during character creation disappearing if the game is closed without saving right after the opening scene. Can't guarantee that it'll work properly if you quit before the dialogue in the beginning though.
* When NPCs duplicate rods with alchemy, they are no longer stacked into the player's inventory. Remaining charges on stacks of rods will also no longer increase.
* When summoned undead defeat an enemy, allies tagged to the player will now be able to receive AP (albeit a reduced amount) if they are eligible.
* Fixed tagged NPCs not reflecting their speed changes due to buffs.
* Fixed high level NPCs having an overflow in experience and gaining the amount overflowed.
* Fixed quest givers' names going weird in the journal when the player is in another floor of the town.


==1.55==
'''2/14/2016'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added a side quest to part III. (Sophia's.) You may want to turn on the minute display the log in the game settings when you're doing this quest.
** NB: options -> message log (f) -> first option
* Made a slight change to how the reward is given in an existing part III side quest. (Urcaguary's.)
* Added a precious item that can temporarily change the element of Variable Storm and Variable Breath. If it's an element not compatible with the spell or breath, then nothing will happen. Made it available from the small medal shop so that it's available right from part I, and so that people who don't want it don't have to get it.
* Added 8 high-level seamonsters and 1 evolution.
* Allowed selection of 1 skill in addition to the class and race during character creation. The selected skill will start at level 10. If it's a skill that isn't level 0 for the class or race, then 9 will be added to the starting level. It's similar to the ability system you see in TRPGs.
* Feats: changed the arm wrestling feat to Run Wildry skill. Two more skills have been added, and the sexy and martial artist-type feats have been swapped with them. From this version on, the stat-increase feats will be gradually exchanged for feats that give abilities and passive effects that can be used for roleplaying.
*  Made it so that equipment skill (light, medium, and heavy) protects from damage dealt by proximity assist and interlocking shooting mechanism equipment attributes. The damage reduction is capped at skill level 500. 
* Adjusted NPC adventurers' starting level and fame, and their hiring price. Hiring price is now reduced with affection level. Their profile will also be generated randomly, and they won't prefer to stay in North Tyris any more.
* NPC adventurers can be recruited as an ally after hiring him 1 time, as opposed to 3 times before. Adventurers above level 300 will be weakened when they are recruited as allies.
* Added 1 policy for governing towns. It won't show up until the prerequisites are met.
* About the replacement for the alias voting system:
** Voting can now be done in towns where there has been a werewolf attack. When the player has voted and is in town at 12 noon, the NPC with the most votes will be executed. (If more than 1 NPC shares the top vote, 1 of them will be picked.) So go kill the one that you have your eye on (for his items). Execution will increase the player's influence in the town whether the person was a werewolf or not.
* Altered the werewolf option in conversations. Picking it will cause the affection level to slightly lower, but more votes will go to that NPC. This can be done any time from after the werewolf attack till the player checks the ballot box.
* Undead can be tethered to you with a leash like your pets, and will warp to you when they are too far away. Brainwashing no longer affects them.
* Dragon zombie has been changed to predator class.
* Increased the effectiveness of all aspects of necro remodel.
* Necro force HP and MP consumption halved. Added the option to make them gather around you without returning them to their coffins.
* When a summoned undead monster defeats an enemy, AP is earned by the player and is based off the player's INI.
* Summoned undead will not act as summoned undead inside showrooms.
* Added Fury side-effect to Run Wildry status to give it the double-edged sword feel. If the player uses the skill, he will also be confused for a short duration in addition to that.
* Set the upper limit of Holy Shield and Feather DV/PV bonus to 1000 to make unbuffed DV and PV more important. The 10% increase part will remain the same for now. Increased the gain in turns the buffs are active for.
* Gauge attacks will not activate for proc-type enchants that give attack magic or breath.
* Relaxed material requirements for making monster balls. Max level for monster balls set to 200. Monster balls will also not be more than 10 levels higher than lowest dungeon floor cleared.
* When the player eats "Uh-uh, the taste is so so" or "The taste is not bad" food or better, stamina recovers by enchant level * 1.5 + food tier. This was added as a way to recover stamina and as a reason for the player to eat high-quality cooked food.
* Carpentry tool item has been renamed to tools, and its description has been changed. (NB: change does not affect English version.)
* MP Breath is now affected by the equipment attribute that increases breath damage. It is still unaffected by Charge Attack.
* Reduced SP consumption of breath-type actions.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some of the descriptions.
* Fixed characters in main quest part III not talking.
* Influence level in town will be saved, and will no longer reset when starting up Elona.
* Cutscene added in 1.54 no longer replays every time the player enters the floor.
* Score no longer overflows. Upper limit is now more or less unachievable at 100 million. With 20 times the score in no future mode, the limit is 2 billion.
* Coffins of necromancy that are stashed into your graveyard key when you don't have enough space in your inventory will no longer lose their necro remodel effect.
* Fixed number and weight of gifts, tokens of friendship, and chocolate going weird after gifting them.


==1.54==
'''1/18/2016'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added a bit of content to Act III main quest.
* Added 1 precious artifact and 1 unique NPC to Act III.
* Added 1 red book.
* Added 4 new items.
* Added 2 item fusion recipes.
* Added 2 Wide special actions. One of them is for NPC use only.
* Added 2 new water spells. They are very weak but are non-elemental. They will be effective against targets that have high magic resistance, but be sure not to accidentally hit any enemies with Swimming skill. These spells will always make the affected targets wet. They will also wash away any tile-lingering effects (fires, spider webs, etc) within their area of effect.
* Added the Oil status ailment. When affected by Oil, fire-elemental damage will do 1.75 times as much damage. Oiled targets cannot be Wet. Characters that are already Wet can get Oil status, and in this case they will be able to have both status ailments at the same time. The upside to this is that PV and DV will be 1.3 times the base value. Recovered with the passage of time, prayer, and <Vernis Original>.
* Characters hit by molotov, snow, bottle of sulfuric, and tomato no longer get wet.
* Increased damage done by molotov and bottle of sulfuric. They now also will do more damage when blessed.
* Changed the repertoire of the 3 potion-throwing special actions. The types of potions thrown by each has been rearranged so that they're easier to use and understand.
* When one character in a tag team gets wet, the tag partner will now also get wet. However, both members of a tag team need to be holding a magaqua for that item to have an effect. If the player is riding, the steed will now also get wet as well.
* Damage of MP Breath special action is now reduced by magic resistance. It no longer costs gauge, and the MP cost has been halved.
* The chance that breath attacks causes a status ailment was a fixed low value (while the chance for spells to cause one is not fixed and has no upper limit), so this chance will now increase with the user's Constitution and resistance [towards the breath's element]. (It's still lower than for spells and has an upper limit though.)
* Pets in defence mode that have been handed a rod will no longer zap them. (Both attack and support type rods.)
* Big Daddies will now drop their Little Sisters when defeated by your summoned undead.
* Looked over the starting parameters of towns. (Only those on the City Chart.) Most of the parameters have been unchanged. Being able to manage towns will come sometime in the future.
* You will now get praise/authority points for successfully completing quests in a town, and the number of points awarded depends on the quest difficulty. (For escort and delivery quests, points are awarded for the destination town.) When you have 2000 points or more, talking to the town elder will let you manage the town in his stead. That's all that there is for now. For Melugas, you have to clear a sub quest as well in order to do that.
* Carpentry skill has been renamed as Crafting because the latter does not have as narrow a definition as the former. (NB: Name remains unchanged in English version.)

 [Fixes]
* Fixed being unable to switch between putting in and taking out items of 4-Dimensional Pocket if used after giving gifts, tokens of friendship, and chocolate. These items can also now be handed over one after another.
* Fixed Shadow Step not registering as an attack when used by the player against a character with the same character ID number as the quest giver (even when on a different map as the quest giver), if the player teleports towards the quest giver with the quest board. This persisted until the game was closed once.
* Fixed Clash Rush special action deducting HP penalty for usage from the wrong characters.
* Money received for clearing a random dungeon no longer overflows.


==1.53==
'''12/25/2015'''
 [Changes and additions]
* When a new game is started, temporary facilities (that cannot be entered) were placed around towns, and would get removed during the first diastrophism. These will no longer be placed at all. They may be used in the future when a town development system has been implemented.
* Added just a bit of content to Act III main quest.
* Added 4 high-level worm race NPCs.
* Added 6 high-level imp race NPCs. Added 1 evolution.
* Added 1 unique NPC for Act III.
* Added generic enemy NPCs to some Act II and Act III mid-boss battles.
* Fawn On special action has been renamed to Bewitch.
* Added 2 special actions. One of them is for NPC use only.
* Changed the appearance and AI of some existing NPCs.
* Changed the materials required for creation of high potion of aqua sanctio in item fusion.
* Added a more severe version of Bind status ailment called Immobility. While immobile, all teleport-type actions and Shadow Step cannot be performed. Like sleep status, all physical attacks are guaranteed to hit the affected character.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed the crash that occurred because the facility added in 1.52 had the same internal parameter as the temporary facilities placed around Yowyn. That parameter has been fixed, and temporary facilities that have already been created will be removed after a diastrophism event in 1.52 and the game will stop crashing. Updating to 1.53 will also cause a diastrophism.
* Fixed the quest giver's name changing under certain conditions when the journal is opened while outside of the town that the quest was undertaken. As a precaution to prevent this bug, quest giver's names in the journal will now only be refreshed when the journal is opened while in the town that the quest was undertaken.


==1.52fix==
'''12/6/2016'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Fixed being unable to enter dungeons. (NB: This may be referring to the dungeon from deeds, and not random dungeons AKA Nefia.)


==1.52==
'''12/5/2015'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added a new facility to South Tyris. Added 4 new NPCs for it. At this facility you can reset the deepest dungeon floor cleared, quit your existing guild, and reset any secret treasure of saint/wicked used. You can also reset pets' impress, master/servant relationship, marriage, and some other parameters. Like the mansion of younger sister, it cannot be seen on the world map.
* Added content to the Insane book.
* Any changes made to a quest giver's name will now be reflected in the journal. If the name of the recipient of a delivery quest has had his name changed, the name change will be reflected in the journal when the journal is opened in the town the recipient is in.
* The speed penalty for having too many limbs will now also be reflected in a tag team that the character with the penalty is in.
* You can now receive a large amount of materials from your pet at once when choosing to receive materials from them. The amount is 500 times what it was. The colour of the log text saying which materials you received and how many of them have been made to match the skill that they depend on. Gardening skill no longer gives Magic ink, and instead gives Shining weed. The former wasn't a plant and it also overlapped with Detection skill materials.
* Changed the sprites of harpy and dragon's pet harpy. It's now more harpy-ish.
* Added 4 high-level harpy race NPCs.
* Added 5 high-level mandrake race NPCs. Changed the sprite of mandrake.
* Added 4 evolutions.
* Added 1 special action and 3 Wide special actions.
* The damage-over-time from poison and bleeding status ailments is no longer reduced by the metal and armour bit flags.
* Added 2 new colour options. One of them was a duplicate so it has been made colourless.
* Buffed the new 1.51 precious artifact by a little.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some descriptions.
* Fixed the player being unable to be part of or disband tag teams.
* Strength attribute experience is now given for all participants when Lock Break succeeds. The amount awarded is less than that if the lock had been picked the normal way.
* Leold no longer has his position reset to Cyber Dome or Ruoza when he is supposed to have moved elsewhere when the player proceeds beyond a point in the main quest.
* Fixed Greater Evasion not working unless the character was affected by Gravity status.
* Pets are no longer included when counting the number of allied NPCs left on the map during a quest.
* Fixed the height and weight of Melugast typeM.
* Fixed the issue with the amount physical damage received when Emergency Evasion is active.
* Fixed the issue with the player's coordinates when returning from the Act III area for the first time while in the wilderness, then exiting the map that the player had returned to.
* Fixed the issue with the player's starting position if the player talks to an NPC and goes to a hunting quest map in the main quest/for a sub quest, then exits that map, then enters it again.


==1.51fix==
'''11/2/2015'''
 [Fixes]
* Fixed being unable to duplicate the 2 new rods [with Dupli-Cane for the player or with the passive Alchemy skill bonus for NPCs].
* Pets who have been handed attack-type rods will now use them in combat even after crossing over into another map.
* Fixed being unable to talk to Rovid after reaching a point in the Act III main quest.
* Fixed players not clearing the boss battle event after defeating lords of the void.
* Unique NPCs being escorted by the player like Poppy can no longer be set as a breeder, sold, used in gene engineering, be part of a tag team, or have their inventory interacted with.


==1.51==
'''11/1/2015'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added a bit of content to the main quest.
* Added 1 unique Act III NPC.
* Added 1 precious artifact to Act III.
* Created a new world map for the map furniture item. It will change slightly between Act I and Act II.
* Added floor tiles that play a piano note sound when stepped on. There are 24 different pitches.
* Juke box item can now mute the BGM on the map.
* Added 6 high-level lizardman race NPCs.
* Added 1 evolution pattern.
* Added 2 new rods (the magic device).
* Material gathering spots no longer get generated on maps that randomize every time the player enters it.
* NPCs will now have a chance to not use up a charge when they zap an attack rod. That chance depends on the level of their Alchemy skill (it's 80% even at skill level 1). They will receive Alchemy experience for zapping it. Power of the rod is reduced.
* Added a special action that allows usage of rods without consuming a charge. For player use only. Power of rods will be reduced.
* Added an equipment attribute that enhances breath attacks. Waist, head, and arm equipment have a chance of having it. This equipment attribute can be stacked, and at the maximum level it will triple breath damage. Unlike the equipment attribute that enhances spells, this attribute will also affect breath procs from weapon attacks.
* Changed the name and equipment attributes of the <Child Zeder> artifact.
* Ammos can no longer be stolen while equipped. Ammos that are not equipped can be stolen.
* The range of danger levels of random Nefia (dungeons) that get generated during a diastrophism caused by the statue of Opatos is now different from the range of Nefia that get generated naturally.
* Greatly increased the amount of gold pieces given by the statue of Yacatect. That amount will also slightly increase if you worship Yacatect and the amount increased depends on your favour with her. The drop rates of platinum pieces and small medals remains the same.
* Spots that used to have a random Nefia will eventually have a new Nefia on them instead of remaining empty forever. (This does not affect existing dungeons.)
* Breakfast and Handmade gifts events now have an equal chance of picking any pet out of all your pets. However, pets that do not have the required skill will not get chosen.
* Added an item that will prevent a pet getting picked to serve you breakfast or give you a handmade gift in the morning. It is a randomly generated item, but if you update to this version ten of them will get placed at your feet so that you can try them out.
* Added a special action that allows you to work with your pets to break a lock on a container. You can use this when you're alone too.
* If a pet is in a tag team and sells ore items, half of the proceeds will now be given to the partner. 

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some NPCs not getting their portraits displayed properly if you change someone's appearance and load up the portraits in the process before talking to them or looking at their character sheet.
* Fixed untitled red books getting generated.
* Fixed some items that were generated after the generation of a precious artifact getting listed in Oracle.
* Defeating an enemy with Body Blow will no longer cause the dead character to vomit.
* Fixed some monsters spawning in ragnarok when they shouldn't.
* When a high-level mutant spawns, it will now have at most 20 limbs.
* Fixed materials getting inherited anyway if you cancel while inheriting a gene.
* Fixed the placement of the command ring if the game window is too tall.
* Fixed the variable that determines if the player is eligible for a reward not getting triggered if you offer an item to your god with your favour already maxed out.
* Fixed the calculation for escort quest reward.
* Fixed the distortion of the menu screen text that occurs even when the title water effect has been turned off in the options.
* Fixed time stop equipment attribute getting a + displayed in the attribute strength even when the attribute isn't that strong.
* Fixed the 1 tile difference in the distance that light travels in the North/South directions and the East/Wast directions.
* Fixed the custom spoken line file for pets not getting read sometimes.
* Time passed during game events (such as chocolate-making or travelling to/from the Act III continent) will no longer have random events.
* Event triggers will no longer be activated when certain characters get defeated in the EX arena.
* Fixed the item correction code for Cyber Dome. (NB: This refers to the feature where entering Cyber Dome with certain glitched/obsolete items will automatically fix those items.) 


==1.50==
'''9/23/2015'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added a bit of content to the main quest.
* Your summoned undead can no longer be performed to nor preached to. They will also no longer eat, drink items on the floor nor pick up items on the ground.
* Coffins of necromancy created when undead are returned to their coffins will be identified and will neither be cursed nor blessed.
* The map furniture item can now be read. It's a little hard to grasp what's going on in the main quest without knowing the placement of the other countries in game. It uses the file that is included in the development version of vanilla Elona, but I plan to replace it with another version in the future because it's too colourful and the shape of North Tyris isn't quite right.
* Added 5 high-level fairy race NPCs. Changed the sprites of fairy and titania.
* Added 1 evolution.
* Added 1 Act III unique NPC.
* Added 1 item for use in Act III.
* NPCs will now use a ranged attack instead of Swarm when their target is not next to them. If they do not have the proper equipment to perform a ranged attack, they will simply spend the turn increasing their gauge.
* NPCs with a first aid kit in their inventory will now automatically use it when they are low on health. They won't heal for very much if the stats that the heal amount of the kit depends on are low though. Usage of a kit will take precedence over their low-health AI routine, so you can give them first aid kits if you don't want them to use the said routine on low health.
* Juices will now have their blessed/cursed status and + value erased and get stacked when made with a juice mixer.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed gauge of characters with 96-100% in their gauge having it reduced to 95% instead of increasing when they kill an enemy.
* Fixed performing not giving experience like it should.
* Fixed usage of first aid kits and special ammos boxes while they are on the ground not refreshing the tile they are on, causing them to leave behind a ghost item.
* Fixed being unable to play the Act III minigame on the 15th of every month.


==1.49fix==
'''9/6/2015'''
 [Fixes]
* Fixed unlocked doors that were closed by the player being impossible to open.
* Fixed gauge for NPCs that do not meet the requirements to have more than 100% gauge being able to exceed that limit by idling.


==1.49==
'''9/6/2015'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Evolved NPCs, form-shifted characters, and non-pet unique NPCs can now have a maximum of 200% gauge. There are more details about 101-200% gauge in the detailed changelog. When a gauge attack is used at 200% gauge, the attack will ignore armour skill damage reduction and give 1 turn of time stop.
* Unique NPCs now have the same increase in gauge as non-unique NPCs when receiving damage.
* Gauge no longer increases when attacking, using Provoke, or using the Taktstock on a sandbagged NPC.
* Added a new throwing special action.
* Pets will no longer attempt to open doors that aren't locked.
* Evade is now 0 while time has been stopped.
* Added 3 high-level NPCs and 2 evolutions to the angel race.
* Juice will now automatically get stacked when created with a juice mixer.
* Added a new house deed that is 2.5 times as large as a small castle (and slightly larger than a discarded ranch). The maximum number of items is still 400 like the small castle, but it can have 1 more servant compared to it. This is for people who feel that the small castle is too small.
* Added 2 consumable items that can also be obtained through item fusion.
* You can now customize the appearance and abilities of undead from necromancy by using item fusion on their coffin of necromancy and another monster part.
* Unconscious characters now behave similarly to sleeping characters.
* Added 2 new red books.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed summoned undead sometimes getting deleted when they are automatically deployed after constructing a new house.
* Fixed only 2 jerky pieces getting generated no matter how many corpses were stacked on a drydock; it should now generate the number of corpses in the stack x 2 pieces of jerky. Jerky will now inherit love potion and poison that the original corpse was dipped in, but will not inherit infused herbs.
* Fixed pets not getting experience for Ensemble.
* Fixed chaos cumulonimbodragon (NB: no English name) evolved from electric cloud not gaining chaos resistance during evolution.


==1.48==
'''8/12/2015'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added an Act III sub quest. (The ant one.) If you have already undertaken this sub quest before this version, the quest trigger will be reset during the update to 1.48 [so you can go start the quest for real this time].
* Added a multiple-choice quiz minigame. Your score is determined by the amount of real time it takes for you to answer the questions. It can only be started on the 1st or 15th of each month, and talking to the unique informer NPC located in an Act III map will let you start it. Some questions are worded differently but have the exact same four choices, so be sure to read the questions carefully. Doing the quiz the first time should net you about 250 points; 350 points is pretty good for a player who knows the questions well.
* The player is now placed on the south side of the library, Mirage Tower, Rust Plaza, and Shrine of Guardian Act III maps no matter which direction he enters the maps from. If these maps have already been generated, re-entering these maps will refresh them and reflect the change.
* The Amulet of Jure will now have an effect even if the player already has anorexia.
* Jerky no longer rots, weighs 0.1s, and gives as much experience as a rank 3 cooked food item. The satiety it recovers is halved, and the special effects of the corpse it was made from will no longer work. When made on a drydock, its weight will be changed to 0.1s, and it will become unblessed and uncursed even if the original corpse was blessed/cursed. The + value of the corpse will also disappear, and one corpse becomes two pieces of jerky. There is no longer any freshness variable or cursed/blessed status, so jerky from the same NPC will stack. The lower satiety recovered means the player can eat more of them to gain more experience. The removal of special corpse effects means that corpses with undesirable effects can be eaten as well. You may want to decide which corpses you want to cook, and which ones you want to turn into jerky.
* The 3rd melee weapon and onwards now deals lower bonus damage. Having many limbs and many weapons means having the advantage of getting more equipment attribute procs, chances to inflict status effects with elemental damage, and having more resistances and skill bonuses, so the damage dealt has been lowered to even things out a bit.
* Holy Shield now gives a 20% Shield skill buff. Feather now gives a 20% Light Armor skill buff.
* Nerfed the buffs from Cheer and Platinum Song. (They used to be 5 times Charisma, now they are 3 times Charisma.)
* Added 2 high-level ghost race NPCs. Added 2 evolutions.
* Added 5 high-level frog race NPCs. Added 2 evolutions.
* Added 1 unique NPC and 1 precious artifact.
* Added an item that works like how the command flag used to. Randomly generated.

 [Fixes]
* The variable for starting Reading Party now gets reset when the Reading Party is interrupted. The variable for starting Ensemble now gets reset when Ensemble is interrupted.
* Fixed the attributes getting listed when training at the trainer or on the new attribute screen when the Glasses of Yacatect is in the player's inventory.
* Fixed deed detection detecting deeds on both the continent that the player is leaving as well as the continent the player is moving to when the player moves between continents.


==1.47==
'''7/20/2015'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added 2 'W'ide special actions. One is a Literacy version of Ensemble, and the other is a weak AOE attack for NPC use.
* Added two NPCs that spawn only under special conditions.
* The new equipment attribute added in 1.46 now affects damage bonus on top of the damage dice. This theoretically makes the weapon with the attribute the strongest out of all the weapons in the game, including the inner gods' weapons.
* Added a new option the list of choices that pops up during sleep sharing. It adds a random % to the counter on both sides when you choose it. The text of the choice itself can be customized with txtEXAct, and the pet's reaction to that with txtEXReact.
* Implemented the effects of the items added in 1.46 that had no effects. Their effects are rather simple but are all quite powerful and unique. They work when they are in the player's inventory, so if you obtained these items in 1.46 they will work right after updating the game.
* Set an upper limit to the rank of cooked food that can be made with every cooking implement. The limit is stated on each of their item descriptions. You can now use lower rank utensils to make the items you need for town board quests.
* The increase in master/servant relationship when interrupting pets that eat off the ground when they're forbidden from doing so now occurs at most once a day for each pet.
* Used monster balls now weigh a fixed 10s. (The feature where monster balls increased in weight up to 100s as the target's weight increased to 10,000kg was a feature from vanilla Elona.)
* Set a cap for cut damage from the 'cut damage to attackers' equipment attribute. (It's 2 times the damage to attackers that hedgehogs do.)
* Set the cap for eggs laid after quaffing a love potion to 100s. The price calculation remains the same.
* Changed the layout of the entrance of the discarded ranch. Only newly placed discarded ranches will be affected.
* Added 2 new red books.
* Items marked as important can no longer be thrown.
* Sprits from Summon spirit, zombies from Summon chaos, alien kids from pregnancy, and the generic monsters placed alongside the Act III mid-bosses have a higher starting level than usual, so they can no longer be dominated so that other choices for pets are viable as well.
* Reduced the item drop rate for characters with the IsSummoned bit flag.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some card descriptions.
* Fixed the height and body weight of Yerleswood type M.
* Fixed item names for items that had their appearance changed and were at slot plan16 and onwards not getting their names properly read from their files.
* Being unable to move due to an overloaded cart is now limited to the world map. Trade goods the card can also no longer be interacted with outside of towns and the wilderness.
* Fixed being able to get up to 7 additional melee attacks even when not using Martial Arts with nothing equipped in the hands.
* There will no longer be a metallic sound effect played when talking to the shopkeeper if the number of goods at their shop has been increased due to your selling trade goods on the map.
* Fixed the crash that occurred when calculating damage dealt when a mine is triggered on 2F of your house.
* Fixed the duel not ending when you defeat the duel opponent in the showroom or in Amur-Cage.


==1.46==
'''6/28/2015'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added an event where pets who are Soul Mate or above will stay up late at night to craft armour for you. This event has a chance of occurring when you wake up in the morning or afternoon if you don't stay up late at night. If Tailoring skill is higher, they will craft light armour; if Carpentry is higher, they will craft heavy armour. Higher skill levels will enable them to craft a wider variety of armours, and they will be able to craft better armour types more often. Their spoken lines can be customized with txtCreate.
* Added a Act I sub quest where you can receive a reward for every 50 different types of cards in your deck. Added a facility in North Tyris for this quest. (It will be placed after a diastrophism.)
* Physical damage reduction of Super Armor buff has been reduced. It now reduces at most 75% of HP's worth of damage.
* The Emergency Evade buff now also reduces physical damage by 20%. It's something like evading the brunt of the attack even if you fail to completely evade it.
* The Magic Equip buff now also reduces 20% of magic element damage. (Not magic damage!)
* Implemented the effects of the duel glove. The target will become hostile without lowering your karma, and defeating it will neither lower karma nor impress. When defeated, they will drop better items. However, it will not be possible to exit the map when in a duel. It's best to be fully prepared before using this item.
* When NPCs are in combat, if they do nothing during their turn and their gauge is 80% or below, then their gauge will increase by 15%. This does not include NPCs who are in defence mode.
* If your cart is too heavy, you will no longer be able to move (just like if you were Overweight!.) You won't receive any damage because it's not like you're carrying it on your back.
* If you sell at certain amount or more of trade goods at a trader, the other shops on the same map will temporarily sell an increased number of items, with the number of additional items depending on the amount of trade goods sold (and up to 20 additional items). Buying and re-selling trade goods on the same map will have no effect. The items for sale at each shop will be increased when their shop inventories get randomized (NB: when the player talks to them for the first time after a shop refresh), and the number gets reset when the shop is refreshed. (Shops inventories that have already been randomized will instead have their number of items for sale increased after the next shop refresh.)

* Altered the ease of gaining and invoking the invokes grenade equipment attribute so that it matches the bolt-type invoke equipment attributes. This does not affect the Nova Grenade artifact grenade invoke chance.
* Added new items that are guaranteed to drop from the demi-gods (NB: Karavika et al). Their effects have yet to be implemented.
* There can now be up to 7 additional melee attacks when attacking with martial arts while nothing is equipped in the hands. (That makes it a total of 8 attacks including the regular attack.)
* Made adjustments to how powerful the boss added in 1.45 is.
* Added 2 evolutions.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed part of the code that placed unique NPCs in Melugas.
* Fixed gifting engagement rings and amulets getting the anniversary bonus even on the day of recruitment/marriage.
* The interlocking shooting mechanism and proximity assist weapon attacks no longer proc if the target is dead.
* Fixed some of the icons on the item fusion window.
* Fixed some of the main quest triggers.
* Fixed some text, like conversations and descriptions.
* Fixed the mistake in the conditions that had to be met for the 1.45 unique NPC to show up.
* Fixed the maximum level of NPCs available for sale at the slave and horse master not getting reverted to normal.


==1.45==
'''5/24/2015'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added just a bit of content to Act III main quest up to a mid-boss battle.
* When talking to a CNPC that is not a pet in a showroom (and only in showrooms), that character's lines will be spoken in order and not chosen randomly.
* Made slight changes to how you change a character's sprite. You can now preview the sprite while changing it. It is now possible to change the appearance during shift core usage.
* Transformation with a shift core now takes more turns.
* Increased the proc chance of breath invokes by 30% (3 times what it was). Increased the proc chance of bolt-type invokes by 5%.
* The lines spoken by pets when the player uses Drain Blood on them can now be customized with txtDrain. If impress is Fellow or above, or if master/servant value is Amenable or above, Drain Blood will not do any damage to them (they won't glare at you either) and they won't bleed as much.
* Increased the effectiveness of MP absorption equipment attribute.
* Black gemstone of Wake up nefia's cooldown has been reduced to 48 hours.
* Mani's gemstone now attacks only enemies, and deals magic-element damage.
* Chestnuts will now remain on the tile they were thrown at.
* Reduced the platinum pieces required for training.
* The nether damage done by thrown skull swords now ignores defence (but not resistance). They will also now deal damage based on their weight. A more powerful version of it can now be crafted with item fusion.
* Added high-level NPCs to the rabbit and bat races.
* A certain unique NPC will now get more powerful as you progress through the main quest.
* Buffed Bind status effect - it used to reduce evade to 1/5 of the original value; it now reduces evade to 0. Greater Evasion will still work. Halved the number of turns that Bind special action is active for; it now lasts for 10 turns.
* Riding skill experience is now awarded for the steed and the player when receiving and evading physical attacks.
* The slave master and horse master now sell up to level 130 NPCs.
* Changed the items that an Act III unique NPC will trade to you.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed Converge Breath not hitting allies.
* There is a special Lomias tutorial event that has been in the game right from vanilla Elona. (This has nothing to do with the secret experience.) It wasn't functioning due to a bug, but it has now been fixed.


==1.44==
'''4/26/2015'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Tentatively added items that buffs stats, change appearance (walking animation/sprite), name, and portrait. These are also usable on pets. They will be placed at your feet during the update just for this version for you to try them out. Different items will change your stats in different ways. You can change its sprite and name at Garokk as well to help with your roleplaying. You will hvae to set your portrait, name, and appearance after transforming. (It won't be possible to do it before transforming.) The above parameters (appearance etc) are stored separately from your regular parameters.
* Added an item that can turn fruits, vegetables, and nuts into juice. They will not have any change in their value or nutritional value after turning in juice, nor will they gain any bonuses from + value. Whether the original food item was rotten or not will not matter, and you can spam lots of these in a short time. You might want to cook food items if they had a + value, and turn them into juice if they didn't. Mixing two juices will turn it into mixed juice and give 1.5 times the experience. (Mixing mixed juices will still give 1.5 times the experience of a regular juice.) Juice can also be mixed with milk.
* Added just a bit of content to Act III main quest, right up to a mid-boss battle.
* The "Attack" option that appears when interacting with NPCs can now be completely turned off or set to display only for NPCs aside from your pets under the game settings.
* Coffee can now be mixed with milk.
* The list of pets show after using Directive will now also show the NPC being ridden.
* Added high-level NPCs to the horse, minotaur, and rat races.
* Changed the sprites of 4 existing NPCs.
* Added evolution patterns.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed the evolved chaos cloud and electric cloud not using the special actions it gained like it should.
* Fixed Magic not returning to its normal value after using Over-Ray special action.
* Fixed brainwashed summoned undead not returning to their coffins, and not becoming coffins even if they die and dropping items instead.
* Fixed some descriptions.
* Fixed refraining from picking up items on the ground using the master/servant value for the last character targeted instead.


==1.43==
'''3/15/2015'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added one sub quest to Act III. (Nein's)
* Increased the number of user portraits (face*.bmp in the user/graphic folder) to 40.
* Astral light pen can now be used in the Void. Whether you are actually able to use it or not will depend on the target's level in the void including the void bonus. The NPC that gets recruited will not have the void bonus to its level.
* Added a non-AP feat that gives a +20% bonus to Speed when alone (i.e. there are no pets or allied NPCs on the same map).
* Forced sleep sharing now has a higher chance of succeeding the lower the target's HP is.
* Added high level NPCs to the lich, rock, wisp, and spirit races. Added 4 evolutions.
* Added 3 precious artifacts.
* Aloe, quwapana, and guava are now recognized as fruit during item fusion.
* Weapon throwing animation is now affected by the colour of the thrown item.
* Made changes to the skill bonus selection available when leveling up a living weapon. Every skill except weapon skills can now be chosen, and these skills are grouped into four choices. For more details on how they are grouped, look at the detailed changelog.
* Elemental equipment from "of night" to "of magic" have had their rank increased, and their random generation no longer competes with the elemental equipment ranging from "of fire" to "of lightning".
* Karma no longer decreases when a summoned undead belonging to you is killed by an attack from a friendly NPC.
* If the conditions are met, summoned undead will now also get automatically summoned when moving on to the world map.
* Summoned undead no longer catch the player pickpocketing.
* Monsters bred on the ranch will occasionally have traits such as increased corpse quality or increased milk production. When the breeder has traits, monsters bred from it are more likely to come with traits as well. It's sort of like artificial selection. You might want to retire old breeders or have promising monsters start new ranches to increase the number of livestock with the traits that you want. Their traits become apparent when Rubbing them with a brush.
* Livestock and breeders on the ranch can now be moved with a house board or a register. New livestock always get generated in the enclosure in the centre, so you can move your breeder to a small room at the sides to better manage your ranch.
* You can now tell a pet to abstain from items on the ground. (NB: is mistranslated/untranslated in English as of 1.59, and where it still says "Designated as precious ally.")
** Picking up of items will be prevented 100% of the time, while eating/quaffing off the ground has a higher chance of getting prevented as the master/servant value (listed below Impress) increases. When the pet can't resist it and starts eating, changing positions with it to stop it from eating will increase master/servant relationship. If the player doesn't stop it from eating, then master/servant decreases. Love potions will slightly increase master/servant value as well. Cursed love potions will lower it. The description of each stage of master/servant relationship has been changed.
* Method of obtaining Riding skill experience has been changed from "attacking with a physical attack" to "passage of turn while riding". (This makes it the same as Stealth.) The character being ridden will also gain Riding experience. Pets riding you will gain twice as much experience.
* Directive special action no longer shows the list of pets that you have with you, and now lets you keep giving commands to your pets. The turn will end after you finish giving commands though.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed your undead also becoming hostile with all the other NPCs when breaking into a guild.
* Fixed some spells affecting your undead when they should not.
* Fixed corpses outside the ranch also getting quality modifiers.
* Fixed the equipment attribute added in 1.42 not appearing on the type of equipment it was supposed to.
* Fixed special actions that aren't supposed to consume a turn consuming one.
* Fixed the code for evolution of penguin and snail.
* Fixed characters on the right of a tag team not receiving the effects of a picnic basket sometimes when the pet on the left moves.
* Prevented werewolf events from happening outside towns.


==1.42fix2==
'''2/21/2015'''
 [Fixes]
* Fixed the code that executes when the Resurrection spell and book of resurrection activate.


==1.42fix==
'''2/21/2015'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added the conditions for triggering each of the custom lines to the flavour text sample as well as to the CNPC template.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed being unable to call back your pets or call the ones staying at your home at the bartender or with Call Familiar if you currently have the maximum number of pets with you.
* Restored "Dig" option to the quick menu.
* Prevented the crash that occurs when executing an additional attack with interlocking shooting mechanism via the new equipment attribute. Prevented damage dealt from that from overflowing.
* Fixed martial arts text getting changed to one that doesn't exist and crashing the game if you choose to not change the flavour text for martial arts at the Doujou.
* Fixed the trigger that marked the player as being eligible to receive a picnic basket at the Maid house getting cleared when closing the game.
* Sub-routines will no longer get nested by repeated usage of special actions that don't consume a turn. (To prevent HSP error 29).
* Upgraded the internal version. (The save file for this version is no longer backwards compatible for 1.41, 1.41fix, and 1.42.)


==1.42==
'''2/15/2015'''
 [Changes and additions]
* There are quite a few special actions now, so the area of effect special actions are no longer listed in the list brought up by 'a' key, but are instead under a new list brought up by 'W' (shift+w). The following are those special actions:
** Houzanha, Dimensional Move, rampage, Cheer, Tag Force, Necro Force, Alchemical Rain, Provoke, Synchro hearts, Pressure, Emergency Evasion, Magic Equip, Super Armor,  Ensemble, Preaching, Over-Ray, Mana Burst, Shadow rush, and Fire a volley.
** If you find yourself forgetting which key to press, just remember 'W' for 'Wide Area' special actions.
* Added a bit of content to Act III main quest.
* Added two unique NPCs and precious artifacts to Act III. The new portraits are drawn by me, so I'm looking for people to help make them match the existing ones.
** Added 4 high-level zombies. One of them is an alternative evolution.
** Added 6 high-level snails. The regular snail now has 2 stages of evolutions.
* Made slight changes to the deck editing screen.
* The chance of vomiting when drunk is now decreased as the number of alcohols drunk by that character increases. For the player, the chance of *stagger* occurring also decreases, and the number of alcohols drunk is now listed in the journal. (You'll need to turn on record display in the settings.)
* Buffed Holy Shield, Feather, Hero, and Divine Wisdom. They will now buff attributes by an additional 10% of their respective attributes' values regardless of spell level. They will also now last for at least 10 turns, but the number of turns they last for will not increase as much as spell level increases. This is to help characters (especially NPCs) that aren't that powerful even with buffs and require a lot of training to become useful.
* Added 3 new equipment attributes. These will be generated only on miracle and godly-level equipment.
* NPCs' critical hits will now be displayed in the log. (It will say 'Critical Hit!' in blue text.)
* Increasing speed with AP will increase it by 20 for the player each time, and 30 for pets.
* Capped number of undead from necromancy to 15 including pets on the map with you. Pets can also no longer be recruited if the number of undead summoned plus pets on the map is 15 or more. Only pets that are alive and with you will be counted; pets waiting in town will not.
* Added an item that can store up to 15 stacks of coffins of necromancy.
** Use it with the 't' key. Items stored in it do not add to its weight, and these items all share the same inventory.
** It is randomly generated, and there will also be one in Lumiest graveyard from the start.
** If you have this item in your inventory, all the summoned undead that you have with you will be automatically stuffed back into their coffins and then into your inventory when exiting a map. (NB: As opposed to summoned undead getting left behind in the previous map.) Coffins that cannot fit into your inventory will be placed within this item. However, coffins that were already in your inventory when you were exiting the map will not be placed into this item. Undead that are stuffed into their coffins this way will automatically get resummoned on the map that the player moves into if there are empty tiles around the player for them to stand on. Coffins placed in the item will not be automatically resummoned.
* Up to 100 stacks of books and scrolls can now be stored in bookshelves, up to 60 potions for racks of potions, and up to 20 stacks of bread in show cases of bread. They can be used as tools with the 't' key, and function only in your house and the Maid house. Items in these containers do not add to the container's weight, and they all share inventories with other items from the same category. Containers generated in previous versions will not have this function.
* Added an item that feeds all allies. All pets - whether they are sleeping, paralyzed, or out of your range of sight - will immediately teleport to you when this item is used.
** This item can be created with item fusion, and can be received at Maid house every month on or after the 10th and the 20th.
** This item will increase all attribute potential (including speed and luck) for all characters that ate it by the average of the cooked food rank of the items used to make it (if you made it via item fusion) or by a fix value (if received from the Maid house). Getting interrupted while eating will not give you the effect.
** Corpses and eggs used as materials in crafting this item will not give their additional effects.
* Partially changed how pets recover their potential through training. It used to select attributes and skills at random 100 times and then recover them 1% each time. It will now recover all attribute potentials by 2% each (except for speed and luck), and all skill potentials by 3% each. That means that there is no longer any reason to learn as few skills as possible. Training cost also depends on the starting value of the attributes (INI), and training cost will no longer increase as that character's stats increase.
* The descriptive text for martial arts and casting can now be changed at the Doujou. The default text for those are different for each of the races, but you will now be able to customize them for every character regardless of their race (including the player and pets).
* HP bar of allies who don't count as pets (like friendly forces in quests and NPCs being escorted) is now yellow in colour.
* Buffed collected power and Time Stop special actions.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed the text for the Combat Rolls section on the character sheet.
* Fixed pets in Onslaught mode not using gauge attacks in the arena.
* Fixed the issue with some parts of the text in conversations after leaving the battle map in Act III main quest.
* <Poppy> the little dog from the sub quest can no longer be left at the Doujou if it is following you. If it is already at the Doujou, it can be taken out. It can be left at the Doujou if you have recruited it as a pet.


==1.41fix==
'''11/30/2014'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Alchemical Rain special action can no longer be targeted (i.e. you no longer need to target it).
* Buffed the HP leech effect of the skull sword attack item.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed selecting to erase an equipment attribute on a piece of equipment setting its strength to 0 but not erasing it during artifact fusion.
* Fixed the issue with the text in some conversations in Act III main quest that could occur depending on whether some events have been triggered or not.
* Prevented crashes that could occur if skill experience overflows.
* Fixed the crash that sometimes occurred when giving bonus skill experience from Learning attribute if skill experience earned was 0.
* Fixed the bag icon not displaying properly on the second page of the item fusion window. The icon indicates that the player has the materials required for that particular recipe.


==1.41==
'''11/27/2014'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Special actions are now listed in the order of the attributes that they depend on.
* Cost of learning a new skill at the trainer has been greatly reduced and starts at 5 pp, with an upper limit of 15 pp.
* Added 6 new monsters. 1 of them is a unique boss, and another is one that doesn't spawn naturally.
* Changed the sprites of the king in yellow and nyarlathotep. Added a sprite for female rogue bosses.
* Added a mid-boss battle to Act III main quest. Moving to the map will have no effect on you. There is a map-wide effect that causes the gauge of some of the generic monsters on the map to increase up to 50%, and it lasts until the boss is defeated.
* Number of items that can have their sprite and name by changed by Garokk at a time has been increased to 33. Items from 21-33 use 48*96 sprites. You can now revert the sprite to the default by entering 0. (Will not work for items that have already been changed before this version.) There has been some new code added for this feature, so if you find something wrong with the items after customizing them please let me know.
* Changed the types of NPCs that spawn in shops and museums placed on the Act III world map.
* Some NPCs will now be placed on the Act III facility after they die. (2 x imp, Koala, tester, palace magician).
* The damage dealt from "deals massive damage to gods, dragons, and undead" equipment attribute is now affected by the strength of the equipment attribute. The equipment attribute will now increase 1.5 times as much for living weapons.
* The stat reduction that happens when recruiting god and custom NPCs as pets no longer occurs when inheriting pets after reincarnating. The lower cap for attribute reduction is now 50. Attributes below 50 will no longer be reduced when recruiting.
* There is a low chance that NPCs will get angry and become hostile when they are asleep and you wake them up with a whistle. Pets will no longer have that chance to get angry.
* Halved the weight of rod magic devices. Greatly increased the charges on attack-type rods. (The charges drawn will be less.)
* Fill Charge no longer restores a random number of charges; it now restores +2 charges. Number of charges restored to spellbooks remains the same at a fixed +1 charge. Magic device destruction has a chance of occurring when the device fails to charge can now be prevented by Control Magic skill level (max reduction of chance to destroy the device is 99%, achieved at skill level 100).
* The reward for town board quests is no longer greatly reduced if the level of the quest is a lot higher than your lowest dungeon floor cleared.
* Added a special action that uses up a potion of your choice and drenches all characters (including the player) in visual range indiscriminately with it. It will be slightly less effective than if the potion had been thrown directly. Hermes blood and potions of potential cannot be selected. Love potions can be selected, but the impress increase that they cause is halved, and it will neither cause eggs nor milk to be produced. With this, you can buff everyone if there are no enemies around, or spread around status effects that you and your pets are immune to, or to make NPCs wet.
* Added 3 item fusion recipes that players will start off with by default. The items are used for attacking, and should be readily craftable in either early- or mid-game. They are used by throwing them, and are not consumed after throwing although you will need to retrieve them. Their power is subject to balancing.
* Changed the amount of Tactics and Throwing skill experience that throwing items (non-equipment) gives. It now gives somewhat more experience because they can't be infinitely thrown like a weapon.
* Made high potions of aqua sanctio, soma, nektar, and disaster easier to craft.

 [Fixes]
* When reincarnating a gene, the new character's starting money will increase with the parent's money. The starting platinum will depend on the parent's total main attributes, and the starting skill points depends on the total skill levels. The code for this exists in vanilla Elona, but has never worked before this due to an issue with it.
* Fixed the text displayed when another character is already on the tile that you moved a stayer at your home to, as it made it sound as if the former character is the one that you want to move.
* Fixed the cursor failing to scroll past tag teamed characters when targeting mode is activated with the * key and scrolling through targets with the + key.
* Fixed the crash that could occur when targeting mode is activated with the * key and while attempting to scroll through targets with the + or - keys when there are no characters that can be targeted on screen.
* Fixed the younger sister in the Removal of sister sub quest speaking the Act III version of her lines when the player reaches the beginning of Act III main quest.
* Fixed the issue where pets inherited after reincarnating would still have the AP special actions Struck Out and Zero Shoot.
* Fixed the issue where there code to determine if there is a facility at a coordinate on the world map would detect facilities [at that coordinate] on other continents.
* Fixed tree cutting sometimes getting interrupted by pets eating. The tree being cut down will now be marked as an item in use. It wasn't marked as such in previous versions, causing the issue.
* Fixed traits from multiple characters' traits getting listed on the Feats and Traits window. If you find any other issues with this, please report them.
* If there are already 15 equipment attributes on a piece of equipment when doing artifact fusion, you can now erase the attribute of your choice.
* To prevent people from indefinitely being able to eat food and gaining the perks of that, food eaten with Scavenge in showrooms and the EX arena will no longer have any effect. It will still consume the food item and recover the user's HP though.
* Fixed being unable to read treasure maps on the Act III continent.

'''10/10/2014'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Fixed Body Blow special action having its user undefined. Also fixed other characters receiving the Body Blow effect instead if the original target is killed by a regular attack right before the special action takes effect.
* Fixed the crash that occurred when using Squeeze special action with less than 10 Strength.
* Fixed the crash that occurred due to a missing section of code when the Voracity Fang special action causes the user to become too bloated and vomit.
* Fixed the crash that occurred when executing the targeting code used in BakuretuKen, the informer NPC, and so on.


==1.40fix==
'''10/5/2014'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Fixed characters in a tag team appearing where they're not when entering town board quest maps.
* Fixed a boss NPC not being a unique NPC because I forgot to mark it as such.
* Fixed the crash that occurred when using the spell/magic device gauge attack while wearing no equipment. Also fixed being unable to find the target sometimes when using the gauge attack after a ball-type AOE spell.
* Changed the variable that stores anniversary dates for characters. Characters that have already been recruited as pets or are already married to you will have their anniversary set to the date you first talk to them after the update.
* Fixed the crash that occurred when making a gene when there is a character in a tag team.


==1.40==
'''10/5/2014'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Implemented the sub quest "From the sea of stars". Added a new koala part to the "Revenge mountain" sub quest. (You'll need to be in Act III to have access to that.)
* Added 3 types of new monsters.
* Characters that were generated via splitting or summoning in hunting quests will no longer count towards the number of targets left. (Killing the monsters that were placed at the start of the quest will clear it.)
* There is now an anniversary date for every pet (displayed on the conversation window). It will change from the date that they were recruited to the date you were married with them when you marry them. Characters who are already pets or are already married to you will have their anniversary date set to the date on which you first talk to them after the update. Gifts, proofs of friendship, engagement rings, and engagement necklaces will increase twice as much impress when gifted on the anniversary date. There may eventually be an anniversary event in the future, but for now it's just a purely aesthetic feature.
* Bonus Alchemy skill experience can now be rewarded for creating coffins via necromancy. Removed two of the required ingredients for creation of coffins via item fusion, and the material is no longer limited to hearts. The difference in levels between the types of undead created from necromancy has been reduced. The player will also now gain Anatomy experience when an undead defeats an enemy.
* Enemies in the pet arena (except in EX battles) will now have a level modifier that depends on your rank and the number of consecutive wins.
* The calculated evade when affected by Bind status effect is now 1/5 of the normal value.
* The Brave feat has been renamed to "Against the Odds", and its effect has been changed to increase damage as HP decreases.
** NB: It's still called the Brave feat in English.
** Random mobs in Awakened Nefia will no longer have this feat. (Bosses may have it.)
** AP cost has been reduced to 1500. Characters with Brave feat will have that feat swapped for this, and have the difference refunded. This can temporarily exceed the AP limit, but be careful as earning any additional AP will set the the current amount to the limit.
* Changed Mana Burst special action from being dependent on max MP and expending 3 times max MP to being dependent on current MP and expending current MP. When there is not much MP left, then it will depend on Magic attribute, and expend an amount of MP equal to that attribute. It will also no longer hit allies when used by an ally.
* Characters summoned during the pet arena will become the audience, and will no longer attack or get in the way of participants.
* Pets recruited from scroll of ally, diaries, opening monster balls, and servant NPCs rewarded from gods will no longer have a chance of being a boss mob.
* Skill and attribute experience received is lowered as current skill/attribute increases, but that effect has now been reduced to 2/3 of what it was.
* When the absolute piercing attack [equipment attribute] procs (and I'm not referring to attacks with 100% pierce weapons), the target's PV will now be greatly decreased for 3 turns after dealing damage. Piercing ammo will decrease PV for 1 turn.
* Unique NPC pets and variants (NB: monsters that randomly spawn with brackets around their name) can no longer nullify death word, destruction of items in their inventory, and attribute reduction caused by anorexia.
* Stave gauge attack will now also cause a large amount of DV reduction for 5 turns.
* Spell and magic device gauge attack is now single-target, and has increased damage. It also recovers a small amount of HP and MP dependent on amount of damage dealt.
* Characters at 100% gauge will no longer lose gauge as turns pass.
* The player will no longer automatically proc gauge attacks. By using the <Gauge Release> special action, the next attack will now proc the gauge attack. No turn is expended for using <Gauge Release>. This special action is automatically learned during the update. New characters will learn it when they level up. Pets will use gauge attacks only when in Onslaught mode.
* The player and pets (including other players' pets in showrooms and so on) no longer have gauge attack damage dealt capped at half of the target's HP.
* Struck Out special action now affects the target even if it isn't hostile towards the user.
* The danger level of generated random dungeons is now affected by the following:
** continent the player is on : extent of main quest progression : lowest dungeon floor conquered
** in the ratio 2 : 2 : 1.
** The lowest dungeon floor conquered will also be set to main quest progression during the update.
* Equipment enchant scrolls have their respective enchant caps raised by 2. Greatly reduced the cost of enchanting equipment at the blacksmith.

 [Fixes]
* The target can now be chosen when throwing potions at a tag team.
* Prevented members of a tag team from having different speeds if the members are tagged in the order that they appear in the pet list and are then affected by Speed.
* Fixed sox equipped by the player getting counted when submitting sox in a quest and causing the counter to be wrong.
* Fixed the player's karma getting reduced when certain special actions hit friendly NPCs because those special actions get recognized as an attack from the player.
* Fixed the problem where the save data from vanilla Elona stable version could not be read unless it is updated to vanilla beta version before updating to Elona+ due to item fusion recipe data values.
* Fixed being able to flip the item fusion recipe page out of bounds and crashing the game.
* Fixed the lag that occurred at a high number of consecutive wins at the pet arena.
* Fixed the pet arena bonus reward cap disappearing at 300 consecutive wins.
* Fixed the crash that occurred when attempting to place tagged characters on a map that has no empty tiles available.
* Total AP earned is now initialized to 0 for inherited pets after reincarnating.
* Fixed the crash that sometimes occurred when handing weapons to pets and equipping it in their hands right after Ensemble or Preaching.
* Fixed the crash that sometimes occurred when applying the effects of Retention special action, and also fixed effects getting applied to characters who aren't there.


==1.39==
'''8/31/2014'''
 [Changes and additions]
* If part of the save file cannot be read or does not exist, a message will now be displayed and the game will close.
* This is kind of late, but 3 items that can change a character's race will be placed at the player's feet during the update. This is for the characters that have had their races erased after due to race mergers. These items will be generated even if there are no characters with missing races. Be sure to update the game while standing on a map that has item space.
* Added just a bit of content to the main quest.
* Added a few new monsters.
* Sleep sharing will no longer occur by default. The event will now only occur for allies who have been handed an item (a bolster, actually) and are at Friend status or above. (NB: item is the sleep sheep.)
* Halved the cost of replenishing special ammo. You can now replenish all special ammo for all pets at once at the blacksmith. It won't be possible to replenish ammo again until you have changed map once, though.
* When refunding AP, the cap can now be temporarily exceeded. However, earning AP while over the AP cap will reduce current AP to 2000.
* Gauge attacks will no longer proc when attacking with Knockout.
* PV and damage bonus from equipment weight has been changed from +1 per 10s to +1 per 5s of weight. +40 is the limit.
* The cap for the equipment attribute that enhances your spells is now 2.5 times.
* Removed the distance-dependent damage reduction for all attack spells including ball-type spells.
* Added a special action that causes all allies to fire a bolt spell that depends on the sum of everyone's Magic attribute. However, if the sum of Magic is greater than 10 times the user's Magic attribute, then it is capped at 10 times. The target's magic reflect will not work against this, but it can hit allies. This is basically a stronger version of Crystal Spear, but it will not work with the Charge Attack special action. The lines spoken by pets when using Over-Ray can be customized with txtMultiple.
* Fire a volley special action has been changed to consume gauge. SP cost is now 10.
* Added a bonus reward for 100 consecutive wins at the arena and pet arena. Bonus reward is doubled for 200 consecutive wins, and tripled (and capped) at 300 consecutive wins.
* When the player is rank 1 in the arena or pet arena, opponents will be stronger, and their strength will depend on the number of consecutive wins. The starting level of rumbles will rise even if the player isn't rank 1.
* EX battles at the pet arena no longer count for consecutive wins.
* The highest number of consecutive wins is now listed in the journal, under the records section.
* Scrolls of gain attribute are no longer required for artifact fusion with a jewel core of nefia.
* Increased the attribute power cap of Miracle and Godly artifact equipment for artifact fusion.
* When trade goods are bought at traders, their invest level will go up depending on the value of trade goods bought. Invest level will not increase if you sell the goods you bought from them and rebuy it.
* You can now spend pets' AP to increase their quality. This is basically to make them unique NPCs.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some descriptions.
* Fixed the reduction in AP when using an astral light pen.
* Fixed characters on the right of a tag team appearing where it shouldn't be when the tag member on the left disappears after putting him or her away with Call Familiar, due to death, is told to wait in town via conversation, or is abandoned.
* Characters that start with a gun now have their starting ammo specified, because they sometimes got generated with magnum ammo even when they didn't start with a pistol.
* Fixed some ambient sounds (like hard rain) not replaying themselves.
* Fixed the crash that occurred when moving to a hunting quest map or a shelter in town after inviting a god to your house.
* Fixed the long-standing issue where the game crashed when the you flip over to the second page of item fusion recipes with your cursor near the bottom of the first page of recipes after looking at the third page or higher of a shop with at least 3 pages of items. This crash did not occur if you looked at your inventory or items to sell to a shopkeeper after looking at the shop's items.


==1.38R==
'''6/16/2014'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Fixed being unable to allocate pet skill points to skills that the player doesn't have.
* Fixed NPCs gaining skill points when leveling up.


==1.38==
'''6/16/2013'''
 [Changes and additions]
* The dialogue box that pops up at the title screen can now be disabled in the game settings under "Message&Log".
* Rods will no longer have a chance of failing to zap no matter how high the user's Magic Device skill is. Failure rate now decreases as Magic Device skill increases, and it will eventually become 0.
* The "enhances your spells" equipment attribute now affects the power of rods.
* Holy Light has been changed be able to target all allies in range of sight. It is no longer the inferior version of Vanquish Hex.
* Children in costumes will now visit your house in October and beg for candy. The following can be given to them: api nut candy, chestnut candy, acorn candy, romias, <Vernis Original>, fortune cookie, handmade chocolate, and caramel of termination.
** You will receive the same item for giving them any of the above items. If you don't give them anything, though...
* Line spoken during breakfast can now be customized with TxtBfast.
* You can now continually receive materials from your pets by holding down the enter key. The line spoken when receiving materials can also be customized with TxtMaterial now.
* Changed cost of using an astral light pen from "AP equal to the target's level" to "a number of Magic ink material equal to the target's level/10, rounded down to the nearest integer, with a lower limit of 1".
* Added a buff that enhances Perception and Will. A potion and spellbook exist for it. Added the potion version of Feather.
* The type of special ammo can now be specified when changing special ammo with the command flag or with the Directive special action. Time stop ammo cannot be switched to with these, though.
* Undead created from necromancy will now have their HP bars displayed. Added a special action that supports necromancy. It can return all undead to their coffins, remove their status effects, buff them temporarily, make them perform a suicide attack on the enemy, and so on.
* Increased power of Eye of Mana special action. Magic attribute now affects its power more.
* Added a special action that allows you to go easy on the target. It can be obtained by acquiring its corresponding feat. (NB: Knockout.)
** It deals 1/3 of a regular melee attack and always leaves the target with at least 1 HP. Extra attacks and invokes will not proc. If the target is left with less than 1/20 HP or has 1 HP remaining, then the special action will also give the target the Unconscious status effect. (Unconscious will become its lesser counterparts Muddled and Dim with the passage of turns. Will also work on golems.)
* Increased the bonus skill experience from Learning attribute. It was 2 times the square root of Learning; it is now 5 times the square root.
* Added bleed effect to Drain Blood. This effect is one step weaker than the one caused by shurikens.
* Added a custom option to the AP purchase menu. 100 skill points can now be exchanged for 500 AP for pets, and 1500 AP for the player. [Pet] skill points can be allocated by opening their character sheet at the informer, doujou, or discarded ranch.
* Changed AP storage limit to 2000.
* The requirement to earn AP is now 2 times the starting Life, 0.5 times the starting Mana, and 20% of cumulative AP earned so far. Cumulative AP earned thus far is now listed beside current AP.
** AP can no longer be earned from some enemies that have INI below a certain value (i.e. set the lower threshold). In general, the enemies near the end of Act I will start to exceed the threshold.
* Changed the damage multiplier from Bravery feat to 3 times. (NB: Defunct AP feat.) The original speed will now be used when the player is on foot, and the steed's original speed will be used when riding for calculations.
* When a character in a tag team defeats an enemy, the partner that did not land the finishing blow will now earn AP as well if he or she is eligible. (The INI of the partner that landed the killing blow isn't the one that's going to be used for calculations.)
** Amount earned is less than if the character had landed the killing blow. This means that the amount of AP that can be earned for killing one enemy has been increased, and that characters that aren't attacking can earn AP too.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some descriptions.
* Fixed NPCs not equipping unidentified weapons handed to them properly.
* Fixed sub AI routine and forbidding of special actions [with AP] having higher priority than defensive mode.
* Fixed Wet status from rain giving no Swimming skill experience.
* Fixed the player's karma decreasing sometimes when a guard starts fighting a neutral NPC.
* Fixed the issue with the placement of some doors in random dungeons.
* Fixed the issue with the options that are available when interacting with NPCs after using Return on an Act III battle map.
* Fixed NPCs on an Act III battle map speaking the same lines before and after moving to that map.
* Fixed characters hit by acid counterattack automatically becoming the target.


==1.37==
'''5/5/2014'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added a bit of content to the main quest.
* Added quite a few new monsters.
* Added evolutions for Tyrannosaurus and low level spiders.
* Re-added the Healing skill bonus to Regeneration effect; that bonus to HP healed every turn is less than what it was originally though.
* Changed the area that gets darkened when darkening the screen outside of cutscenes.
* Characters in tag teams will no longer move towards the designated chairs when meeting with guests at your home. (This is to prevent the tag team from breaking up.)
* Capped corpse weight during generation at 100s. Prevented price overflow when selling them.
* Fire Wall and Acid Ground will now also deal immediate damage to the characters on the tile that the puddles/fire pillars get generated on, and not just when characters step on to the puddles/fire pillar. Damage is higher than when stepping on the puddles/fire pillar.
* AP is now earned based on the target and the attacker's starting attributes so that you can level attributes without worrying about anything. Amount earned is now about 2 times what it was, and made requirements for earning AP stricter. If riding a horse, either the horse's or your starting Speed will be used for calculation, whichever is higher. The starting attribute value is displayed under "INI" on the character sheet. Existing characters will have their INI values based on their current attributes.
* Monster variants (NB: monsters with brackets around their names) in hunting quests and rogues in a rogue attack can no longer be dominated. Custom NPCs with high attributes will now be weakened when recruited as pets. Their INI value will be calculated after they get weakened to make it easier for them to earn AP.
* When the player has enough favor to receive the final reward from their god, praying at the Truce Ground in November will summon their god (up to once a year). They disappear if you reenter the Truce Ground in December and onwards.
* When your house is rank 1, you can now invite gods (even ones that you aren't currently worshipping) to your house by talking to them. After inviting them, entering or exiting a map will cause them to move to your house. They will not disappear from your house with time. However, you may not invite another god to your house until the one you invited is placed in your home.
* A lot of players don't read the readme, so a notice will now display at the title screen.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed Two Hand bonus not affecting ranged weapons equipped in your hands.
* Fixed door lockpicking difficulty overflowing at extremely deep dungeon floors.
* Fixed some descriptions.
* Fixed inner gods not appearing when you defeat a god in the Void or in a certain Act III map. (The inner gods won't have the void modifier to their levels if you defeat the god in the void.) However, defeating gods in the showroom will still not summon their inner god.
* Fixed spiral king NPCs generated in previous version using Dark Eye spell on itself.


==1.36R2==
'''4/16/2014'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Pets in a tag team will now share money looted off the ground with their partner.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed the crash that occurred when entering the arena if the member on the left of a tag team is further down the list of pets than the member on the right.
* Fixed the crash that occurred when attempting to auscultate a tile with no one on it.
* Fixed pets registered in a showroom not attacking.
* Prevented additional elemental damage from overflowing with Charge Attack.


==1.36R==
'''4/6/2014'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Pets on the world map are now slightly bigger.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some descriptions in the journal.
* Fixed characters dropping generic corpses instead of their respective corpses.
* Prevented pets in a tag team from fighting over food on the ground.
* Limited running speed when the player is in a tag team. Because of how the game is drawn, it won't be as smooth when running.
* Fixed Healing Rain and Rain of sanity not affecting the tag member on the right.
* Fixed the crash that occurred when meeting with a guest when there is a chair assigned to your guest.
* Fixed NPCs in a map not getting saved to showrooms. Only the left member of tag teams will appear in showrooms.


==1.36==
'''3/30/2013'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added an Act III sub quest.
* Added and placed two new unique NPCs in an Act III town.
* Placing an item_*.bmp file into the user/graphic folder will now automatically replace the sprite in item.bmp at that position with your file. This is the item version for the chara_*.bmp sprite replacing system.
* You can now choose what action to take when sleep sharing occurs. You can either wordlessly kick your pet out [of your bed], ignore it, or flirt around.
* You can now choose what actions you want to take during forced sleep sharing initiated by Squeeze. The target will become more servile depending on what actions you take. If you're the kind of person who doesn't like stuff like this, you have been warned. If the target is at Soul Mate or above, then it will just be regular sleep sharing. (Except that you get to pick your target.)
* Changing item name and sprite at Garokk now costs 1 pp.
* Tentatively introduced the 2-man team system. The following are possible: pet + pet, player + pet, (player + steed) + pet.
** Go make your dream team! Example of a team: http://www.elonaup.x0.com/src/up12851.png
** NB: Link doesn't work any more.
** For pet + pet teams, only one of the pets will receive damage when hit by an area-of-effect attack. To be precise, the pet that rolls the higher resist dice will cover the other pet. (Works even for nukes and Meteor.)
** There are also support special actions that buff and heal during tag team.
** The character on the left is in charge of moving and has control over the team formation. The character on the right will fail to move.
** When the player is in a tag team, the screen will no longer scroll even when it is on in the settings. (This is because of how the game screen is drawn during scrolling, and it would cause your tag partner to keep jumping around sideways while trying to follow you.)
** The speed of the team will be that of the slower character. The gauges will be visually half their original length, so they might be harder to read.
* Cheer now works for 5 times the number of turns. Hero is now works 1.25 times the number of turns. Speed and Hero will now run out at the same time. Cheer will also no longer cause Contingency.
* Upped the stats of claw equipment by one notch.
* Changed the stats of the following weapons:
** pistol: distance multipliers changed from 10-09-07-05-03 to 09-10-08-06-03.
** shotgun: distance multipliers changed from 10-06-03 to 10-08-05.
** laser gun: stats are now one notch weaker because its distance multipliers are perfect.
* Pickpocket and Riding skills can now be acquired by pets via the gene machine. However, other unlearned skills will take priority and be learned first.
* Squeeze special action now also causes 1 turn of bind.
* Added an item that causes the holder to be Wet all the time. However, when Wet because of this item, no Swimming skill experience can be gained.
* Added descriptions to cards in the deck that didn't have much of a description.
* Added the new magnum ammo to buff pistols since they were too weak. It is rare and powerful compared to other ammo, and it is only for pistols. (Cannot be used with dual pistols.) Has a negative accuracy bonus. With this, pistols can deal as much damage as other guns and bows.
* Killing livestock on the ranch will now drop their skin in addition to their corpse. Their quality and worth increases depending on the player's Anatomy skill. More skins may drop when the player has high Anatomy skill.
* Harden level and blessed status of weapons now also increases weapon accuracy.
* There is now a +1 damage and PV bonus per 10s of weight for each piece of equipment. The following are the differences between this system and the flying scroll system in the past:
** The bonus is fixed, and is the same no matter what kind of equipment it is and what dice it has.
** The limit is +20 at 200s for each piece of equipment.
** This is easily adjustable because it only requires a change in the calculation, and not the item data for every piece of equipment.
** This does not depend on the weight change, but instead depends on the current weight. That means there is no penalty for making equipment lighter than they originally were.
** May be subject to further balancing and changes in the future.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some descriptions and typos.
* Fixed evolution to fire rat (NB: evolved rat) and soul bee (NB: evolved wasp) not increasing resistances like they should. NPCs that have already been evolved will have their resistances increased during the update if they are on the same map as you when updating.
* Fixed Lay Hand not working on the player sometimes.


==1.35R2==
'''2/24/2014'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Fixed the crash that occurred when certain NPCs receive damage.


==1.35R==
'''2/23/2014'''
 [Changes and additions]
* NPCs that split will no longer split after they have been recruited as a pet.


 [Fixes]
* Fixed the crash that occurred when casting some types of spells.
* Fixed being able to Return to a map used in the main quest. Fixed the target for the damage received when travelling, and reduced the random damage.
* Fixed the player getting a karma hit for using some special actions on Ebon after unchaining him.
* Fixed "... of fire" equipment getting named as "... of night" instead. Equipment that is already named "...of night" will be renamed as "of fire".


==1.35==
'''2/22/2014'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added some content to Act III main quest.
* Added quite a few new NPCs. There are now over 700 of them. With this, the number of NPCs added in Elona+ finally exceeds the number of vanilla NPCs.
* After clearing an Awakened Nefia, there will be a chance that you will get an item for equipment attribute fusion. The chance depends on the dungeon depth (DL).
** Chance that you will receive the item is 0% for level 50 and below, about 2% for level 51, 50% at level 100, 75% at level 200, and 90% at level 200.
** There are ones that increase skills, increase attributes, grant status effect immunity, and rarely ones that lets you see invisible creatures.
** This item is actually an expensive ore, so if it has an equipment attribute that you don't want, just sell it or give it to your pet.
* Increased probability of generation of scroll of gain attribute.
** The probability of finding scrolls is now as follows: superior material > gain attribute > growth
* Increased strength of equipment attributes added to artifact equipment.
** Resistances and skills gain ### each time. (Except for magic resistance, which gains ##.)
** Go make your own original artifact by adding attributes that suit your play style, and by changing its name and appearance at Garokk.
** Don't go overboard with it though, because quests in the future will give items that will grant special equipment attributes like chance of extra melee attack and magic reflect.
* Added elemental equipment for non-primary elements. (Like "____ of fire" equipment for each element.) This makes it easier to mix-and-match equipment in early game to get a full set of resistances.
* When an NPC is not equipped with equipment that enchances spells, then spell power will be increased by Casting skill.
** At 100 Casting, another 5 skill levels in Casting will increase spell power by 1%.
** At 300 Casting, spell power is 1.4 times the original spell power.
** This does not affect pets, and pets belonging to other players in the showroom or at the pet arena.
* If you already seen the event, then the black gemstone of wake up of Nefia will show up in the little sister rewards list even if it hasn't been identified yet.
* Added a special action. It lets you show some serious physical affection for the target.
** The user's Charisma will be rolled against the target's Will. If it succeeds, inflicts 1 turn of paralysis on the target (does not stack), while slightly increasing the target's gauge. You can use this on your allies or on enemies depending on the situation. You can customize the target's response to this with txtFawnOn.
* Halved the required level for pet recruitment with astral light pen.
* When a god race NPC is recruited as a pet, its attributes will no longer be capped at 150. Instead, attributes will be 1/6 their original value. Skills will no longer be capped at 50, and instead they will be 1/2 their original value with a cap of 200.
* The number of pets that can be left at the doujou and discarded ranch is now 150 per map. Slightly decreased the price of a deed of discarded ranch.
* Added an item that stops NPCs from converting to another god if they have it in their inventory. When the player uses it, the current favor, favor limit, and prayer charge percentage will be displayed.
** You will receive one when you convert to another god when not under the Punishment hex. It is also randomly generated.
* When a certain item is used, it has a 50% chance of eliciting a response from dog race NPCs (including foxes) in visual range. Only newly-generated items will have this effect, though.
* When an NPC has been recruited as a pet and it is forbidden from using certain special actions and spells, it will now no longer waste turns trying to use those forbidden special actions/spells, and will instead use its other moves that weren't disabled.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed a chest parameter causing pets to sometimes refuse to take them.
* Fixed nothing happening when trying to make a pet learn Zero Shoot or Struck Out with AP.
* Fixed townsfolk not resurrecting after executing them. Townsfolk who have already been executed will be resurrected if you reenter the map twice.
* Fixed the crash that resulted from werewolf attacks that occur while the player is sleeping.


==1.34==
'''1/26/2014'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Finished an Act III sub quest. There may be an alternate bad ending for it in the future.
* After clearing the sub quest above, you will be able to use an item for fusion and a scroll of growth to add equipment attributes to artifacts (both precious and random).
** Equipment with more than a certain amount of equipment attributes cannot be equipped, however. (You can check the total equipment attribute strength at this location too).
** This is a tentative feature, and you won't be able to add any attributes except resistances at the moment, but more types of attributes will be available for fusion in the future.
* Renamed the gene machine to the ability imparter. Renamed Gene engineering skill to Biochemistry. This is for the folks who don't like the idea of injecting the genes of other creatures into your pet.
** NB: Doesn't affect the English version.
* Added a few new NPCs.
* Werewolves will have a chance to hide in towns right from the start of the game. They also won't reveal themselves late at night (i.e. they won't be hostile, nor will they attack you). Instead, someone will die at 12 midnight if a werewolf is in town. If the target is a unique NPC or a fox, then no one will die.
* If you accuse a townsfolk of being a werewolf and have him executed, your fame will rise regardless of whether you were correct or not.
* If there is a werewolf in town, then there is a 50% chance that a detective will arrive in town when the date changes. The detective will investigate one NPC in town at random, and tell you whether he is human or non-human.
** However, there are also insane detectives and werewolves disguised as detectives. These will tell lies.
** Human detectives have a fixed chance of being the target of a werewolf attack.
* Chests (the ones that weigh 300s) generated from this version and onwards will now rarely have rod of wishing in them. Whether the chest is one that has a chance of having a rod of wishing in it or not is determined when the chest is generated, and only some of these chests will actually have a rod of wishing in them.
** save scumming is therefore pointless. It's the kind of thing that you might come across if you keep playing and get lucky.
* The gauge attack for spells and magic devices will now only activate for attack spells/magic devices (except Meteor).
* Changed the sprites of brown bear and grizzly. They are now brown and grey like their names suggest.
* Added evolutions for low-level golems and bears.
* Changed the probability that the Mist of Darkness spell will cause its effect from 1/2 to 1/4.
* Added something similar to the Mist of Darkness that works against spells.
** NB: Mist of Dazzling.
* Added the throwing version of Swarm, because throwing had neither crowd control nor a special action nor special ammo. If used properly, throwing should now be fairly feasible in combat.
* Rods of wishing can no longer be sold in your shop. The game will also now auto-save at the end of every day inside your shop.

 [Fixes]
* NPCs will no longer gain resistance for an element that they are intrinsically weak to as their level increases.
* Fixed non-rare monsters (Isca, etc) not getting recorded properly in some of counters in the journal.
* Fixed the bugged names for monsters disguising themselves as townsfolk.
* Direct damage (unseen hand, poison, choking, etc, except for trap damage) no longer counts for the highest damage dealt record. The highest damage dealt record will be reset during the update.
* Fixed the number of rogues remaining getting displayed on maps other than the one you encountered them on if you run away or use Return during a rogue attack.
* To prevent crashes, you will now fail to fill empty bottles if your inventory is full.
* When multiple undead from coffins of necromancy are killed with an AOE attack and get returned to their coffins, they all change types, and become the same type of undead as one of the zombies that were killed. This has been fixed.


==1.33R==
'''12/27/2013'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Removed the wait time for resurrecting NPCs. Instead, you will now be able to revive only one pet on a map. When you change maps, you will be able to revive another.
* Marriage will now also give you your partner's card.
* NPCs that start with superb resistance will also have that resistance increase with their levels. For example, the fire crab has the same amount of fire resistance as the red dragon, but with this change, the red dragon will have slightly higher resistance [due to its higher level]. NPCs like these will also start with superb resistance right from level 1.
* When the walls in Tower and Fort dungeons are mined, there is now a low probability of yielding safes, and high probability of yielding stone material.
* Tentatively added the item fusion recipe for creating furniture and other stuff with stone material. Higher Alchemy skill will give you a higher chance of creating a higher rank item, and higher Jeweler skill will make the crafted item have a better modifier (maniac, etc). The gem cutter will not be consumed when used in item fusion.
* Tentatively added the item fusion recipe for creating furniture and other stuff with wood material. Higher alchemy skill will give you a higher chance of creating a higher rank item, and higher Carpentry skill will make the crafted item have a better modifier (maniac, etc). The carpenter's tool will not be consumed when used in item fusion.

 [Fixes]
* Pets will now properly receive experience for zapping rods.
* Fixed some rods not being zapped when there isn't a hostile character around.
* Fixed NPC placement on the map added in 1.33.
* Fixed some maps getting refreshed before a few days has passed.


==1.33==
'''12/21/2013'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Created the final town in the Act III area. I plan to alternate between creating main quest content and sub quests in future update, but nothing is certain as of yet.
* Added a few new characters. 
** cthugha (lv 190) has a 0.5% chance of using Meteor, so watch out for it. If cthugha gets summoned during monster summoning...
* Split up the yith race and named the new races.
** Extraterrestrial gods and rulers from outer space and their descendants are now of the extraterrestrial race. Their starting skill has been changed from Faith to Casting.
** Organisms from the depths of the ocean and the denizens of the deep are now seamonsters. They have high Swimming skill.
** NB: In english, the yith race remains named as such, but seamonsters have been moved out of it into their new race.
* The stalker race has been merged into the ghost race. Slightly increased the attributes for ghost race. Increased starting levels of stalker and shadow stalker.
* Added starting skills for classes (except tourist) that didn't have that many to start with. Referred to >>133 in the discussion thread.
* Changed the default displayed class for some NPCs. (It will act as if a Blank Business Card has already been used on them.)
** e.g. the custom class of maids will no longer be "tourist", and will be "employee" instead. Shopkeepers will no longer have their class displayed as "gunner", and will be "merchant" instead.
** This change will not affect NPCs that have already been generated.
* Gave some NPCs additional skills. For example, shopkeepers and Yacatect will now have Negotiation skill. This will not affect NPCs that have already been generated.
* To prevent NPCs from working to their deaths, resurrection and revival at the bartender will be possible only after 24 hours has passed after death. The number of hours remaining until they can be revived is on the list of NPCs.
* Rare monsters (like Isca) in the showroom and pet arena are no longer counted [in the journal].
* When a pet gains a wish and you wish for a skill, the skill will now be given to the pet and not to the player.
* Pets can now be handed rods and they will now zap them. They will always succeed at zapping a rod. 
** When zapping rods that can be aimed at adjacent cells, they will always target themselves.
** When zapping rods that can be aimed at a distant target (e.g. bolt rods), they will always zap it at their target if they are in combat. If not in combat, they will use their default AI routine.
** When a rod of wishing is zapped and you wish for a skill, the pet that zapped it will gain the skill.
** The rods that will have an effect when used by pets are the ones for attacking, for healing, and for buffing.
** Rods of identify, alchemy, domination, etc will have no effect.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some descriptions.
* Prevented the audience from getting affected by Provoke during pet arena EX battles.
* Fixed amount of gold dropped.
* Fixed certain item fusion recipes yielding the product even when fusion fails. Items may or may not disappear when item fusion fails - is determined at random, and is a feature from vanilla Elona.


==1.32==
'''12/1/2013'''
All town board quests currently undertaken will be deleted during the update, and the quest givers in each town will be reset. Escorted NPCs will die.
 [Changes and additions]
* Increased damage done by chainsickles and whips.
* Prevented equipment attribute that enables Distant Attack from getting randomly generated on equipment.
* Changed the distance multiplier for Distant Attack. Accuracy and power will decrease by 10% per tile away from the target. Minimum is reached at 5 tiles. SP cost is 2.
* Arrow- and bolt-type spells now have distance multipliers like ball-type spells. The multiplier is 100/(75 + distance * 25). The multiplier is x1 if you are right beside the target.
* Towns will have sunbararian NPCs disguising themselves as townfolk. The likelihood of this happening is the same as werewolves. They are not hostile towards you. They are low-level, so they will die easily. They have a low chance of dropping an artifact on death.
* Pets registered at the showroom or pet arena (EX) will now have a special bit flag assigned to them.
** This is so that they no longer have the PV and DV bonuses and the increased HP that unique NPCs have, nor will they be able to use moves that they are not supposed to use.
** The bit flag will be automatically given to pets when you recruit them and also during the update.
** It will not be assigned to pets at the doujou or at the abandoned ranch, so you will need to get them into your party once for them to have the bit flag.
* Tentatively implemented the gauge attack for throwing. It is guaranteed to hit and to be a critical attack, has increased pierce, and has a damage multiplier depending on skill level. The distance multiplier remains the same, so keep in mind the distance between you and the target.
* The player can now learn some special actions with AP. These are more or less just for fun, because all these special actions are ones that you probably won't use after getting them or are kind of hard to use.
** Synchro hearts and Charge Attack which you can probably do without are now available here.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed the ambient noise for towns continuing to play even when you exit the town.
* Fixed the effects on the battle map added in 1.31 affecting your pets assigned as shopkeeper or ranch breeder.
* Provoke and Megid Flame special actions affect only hostile NPCs when used by a non-hostile NPC. If used by a hostile NPC then it affects all non-hostile NPCs.
* Fixed being unable to receive the faith reward artifact if the god has been summoned. The variable has been reset, so if you already have the artifact, you will be able to get just one more if you re-worship the god. That's just how it is.


==1.31R==
'''11/25/2013'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Fixed the variable for resetting quests because it was outdated. Quests will now be generate as they should.


==1.31==
'''11/24/2013'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added some content to the Act III main quest, from the surfacing of the Deep-sea castle to the boss battle.
* Werewolves have a 50% chance of dropping platinum pieces when defeated while they are disguised as a human.
** They will no longer disguise as humans outside towns.
** They will only start to generate in towns on the 1st month of the year 518.
* From January 518 onwards, you can choose one person per day out of all the towns to frame as a werewolf and execute.
** The target can be chosen from 12 noon to 12 midnight. Talk to the target you want to execute and select the option to execute them.
** This is a fallback for people who have discovered a werewolf but are unable to defeat him, and is also a clue as to who the werewolf is, so townsfolk drop nothing when killed by execution. It's better to kill them yourself if you are able to.
* A fox NPC can disguise itself as a townfolk, and the probability that it will happen is even lower than the werewolf event. This is confusing [for players who are looking for the real werewolf], but foxes are otherwise harmless.
** They are strong enough not to die if they get attacked by a werewolf and can fight it 1 on 1.
* The Palmian Embassy and each of the guild maps will now periodically refresh themselves like town maps.
* Pets can now be made to ride the player. The game doesn't determine whether the player is suitable for riding or not, so the pet's maximum speed will be 3 times its original speed.
** When being ridden, buffs like Speed will also affect the rider. You'll need to have your own sprite for walking when being ridden.
** For roleplaying purposes and to make slow pets useful.
* Changed the added effects of Provoke special action. Changed it from "have a chance to debuff target with Mist of Frailness" to "increase user's gauge by number of opponents who got provoked (maximum 20)".
* The command flag and Directive special action can now be used to switch special ammos for pets. The command flag and Directive also no longer take a turn to use.
* NPCs who are not pets and have 50 or more Marksman skill will have a low chance (0.5% for normal NPCs, 5% for unique NPCs) to use some kind of special ammo (except time stop). It doesn't matter if the ammo they are using doesn't have special ammo on it.
* Tentatively added new types of weapons for categories that had only 2 types of weapons in them.
** whip (Stave skill). Enables Distant Attack (range 4). (Players will have it added to their special action tab; NPCs will have a chance of using it.)
** chainsickle (Scythe skill). As above. Unlike other scythes, it cannot decapitate.
** sox (Blunt skill). Are rare like panties.
** ballista (Crossbow skill). Heavy, but high pierce.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed several descriptions.
* Quests were getting generated on maps on the Act III continent when they shouldn't be getting them, and weren't generated on maps that should have quests, so all quests will be deleted during the update. Quest givers will be randomized in each town. Escorted NPCs will die.
* Fixed some buff icons being white and not displaying entirely.
* Oracle will no longer include artifacts that are held by NPCs that were placed when the town was generated for the first time.
** Artifacts that are generated on quest maps weren't listed by Oracle, but now they will.


==1.30==
'''10/27/2013'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added a new map on the northern edge of the Act III continent.
* Added a few new NPCs.
* The troll race is now part of the giant race.
* Races like the bear have been combined into the new largeanimal race.
* character.bmp has run out of space, so buff icons have been moved into interface.bmp.
* Changed where some materials can be harvested. Increased the effect of dungeon type on materials harvestable.
* Incognito and disguise no longer work against unique NPCs.
* Buffed unique NPCs' ability to destroy walls, and also made them able to destroy doors.
* Werewolves will now rarely appear in towns and villages. They are harmless while disguised as humans.
** At certain times of the day, they will reveal themselves and attack the townsfolk. A werewolf is slightly stronger than a new guard. (NB: guard NPCs level up every time they die.)
** It is impossible to tell who the werewolves are, but if you know how NPCs in the towns work, then there are several ways of finding them.
** They have a high chance of dropping a disguise set when they die.
* The signature special actions of the 8 gods are no longer used unless the gauge is full. Their basic routine has been looked over, and it no longer clashes with their preferred distance and aren't reused routines from other NPCs any more.
* 1.4 times as many points from figures and cards are now required for the museum rank to go up by 1. Salary from museum has been tripled.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some descriptions.
* Fixed NPCs in defence mode being able to attack the player.
* Fixed the code for kitty bank.
* Fixed the appearance of some floor tiles.
* Prevented the section for NPC sprites from overlapping and overwriting CNPC sprites.
* The appearance of CNPCs no longer gets reset to their default if their appearance has been changed and they change maps.
* Fixed the bug with how items were used up in the instant ale and necromancy item fusion recipes.


==1.29==
'''9/29/2013'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added a bit of content to Act III main quest. After the event at the main dungeon (enemies have been placed, but there is no need to fight at this point), towns in North and South Tyris will rarely have chaos-type monsters spawning in them. (You will be able to stop this by advancing in the main quest in the future.)
* Added a facility to Act III. Can be entered after the above event. Speak to Norne inside, and you will be able to get to North Tyris. In North Tyris, you can get to Lost Irva by speaking to Norne in Larna.
* Finished a sub quest in Act III. It's a rather difficult combat mission.
* Added quite a few new NPCs.
* Added 2 evolutions. There are now exactly 100 evolutions.
* Some monsters will now glow. If you change their sprite, then they will stop glowing.
* Monsters that split will no longer split unless they have more than 1/3 of health remaining. Monsters with <> around their names will also not split unless they receive more than 1/6 of their health in damage.
* Allies can be designated as important on the conversation window.
** NB: In the english version, it's either "no-drop ally" or "precious ally".
** Important allies cannot be abandoned, sold off, nor used to contribute genes in gene engineering.
* Probability that decapitation will proc on a weapon has been changed from 100% to 44%.
* Sickles were too powerful so their fixed damage has been lowered. Scythes remain the same.
* Added sickle and scythe gauge attack. It will not only do HP, but also MP damage.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed events that occur when ranged gauge is used when riding.
* Fixed starting coordinates being off when moving between Lost Irva and South Tyris.


==1.28==
'''9/13/2013'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added Juke box item. It's for selecting which BGM you want. Can be created by giving 76 music discs to Garokk. You can have duplicates of the same disc number, but you need to have a total of 76 discs on you at the same time. Discs of the same number will stack when dyed the same colour.

 [Fixes]
* Cleared all current quests and fixed the frame shift in quest data. Special thanks to the MMA developer for the advice.
* Fixed NPCs' statuses being wrong after using some items until their stats are recalculated.
* Fixed having profile randomly generated during character creation even when it is set to secret.
* Fixed NPCs appearing where they're actually not due to their coordinates being wrong if they use the ranged gauge attack while being ridden.


==1.27R==
'''9/5/2013'''
 [Changes and additions]
* NPCs in combat no longer lose their target and are also no longer unable to act for 1 turn when a save file is loaded.

 [Fix]
* Fixed the bug where the quest giver was wrong again. Quests that already exist will be refreshed when entering town, so please don't use a save file where you saved in the town when you update to this version.
** When updating, be sure to use a save file where you saved at home.
** When updating from versions 1.25 to 1.27, all quests undertaken will be deleted.
** All escorted NPCs will die again. Without karma or fame loss, of course.
** Quest target markers will still remain, but they will disappear when you talk to them once.


==1.27==
'''9/3/2013'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added a few food items.
* Mining the walls in Forest dungeons will now yield acorn and four-leaf clover.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed the quest giver's name being wrong. Version updates after 1.25 will also clear all quests undertaken. All NPCs being escorted will die. There will be no fame or karma loss though. The quest target markers will still remain, but they will disappear after talking to them once.
* Fixed instant ale and necromancy recipes in item fusion not consuming items.
* Fixed NPCs using gauge attacks even when they don't meet the requirements.


==1.26==
'''9/1/2013'''
 [Fixes]
* Fixed the crash that occurred when receiving salary if the player had less than 3300 gold.
* Fixed one conversation option.


==1.25Rfix==
'''8/31/2013'''
 [Fixes]
* Fixed god-race pets and inherited pets not getting their Pickpocket and Riding skills nerfed when they are made pets.
* Fixed the crash that occurred when acid damage was dealt.


==1.25R==
'''8/31/2013'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Genes can no longer be made on Overdose mode.

 [Fixes]
* I set invest in all shops to 4000 for development purposes and forgot to revert it, but that's fixed now.
* Fixed the item sprite changing system that was accidentally overwritten and made it change the sprites for other items.


==1.25==
'''8/31/2013'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added content to Act III main quest.
* Added a few new NPCs.
* Capped portion of tax that depends on your current gold at 100k gp.
* Added an item that prevents the holder's Fire Bolt and Fire Breath from causing fires. The item will prevent these attacks from causing Wince status though. Fire Wall and molotov items will still start fires, because that's their raison d'etre.
* The sprite for your deeds can now be changed with the house board. Paste the new sprite in the desired numbered position in map.bmp, found in the /graphic folder.
* Introduced the Overdose mode. Attribute experience, skill experience, and spell experience are multiplied by 20. This mode is for people who want to get strong quick, get the game over with, and move on to other games. You'll get bored of this faster than your character will get stronger, so this is definitely not for people who want to savour the real experience.
* Introduced the Inferno mode. There will be a penalty for save scumming, and you cannot crawl up after dying. The save file cannot be loaded after death. Backing up the save file is still possible, of course. If that weren't possible, then it wouldn't be possible to update the game to newer versions. For people who are confident that they'll never die, or for those who get turned on by the feeling of loss.
* Introduced the Natural mode. There will be a penalty for save scumming, but otherwise the same as the regular [Advancing] mode. A game mode where there is no undoing anything, and everything takes its course. For those who want the game to be slightly more difficult.
* Added a few BGMs. Changed the BGM for a library.
* Increased the chance of getting double exp as a result of Learning attribute.
** NB: There is a chance of gaining double exp for doing everything, and that chance gets higher as Learning increases.
* Reusable items that have a cooldown can no longer be used in the Deep-sea castle to prevent their abuse. In addition to that, once you enter the castle, these items' cooldowns will get [constantly] reset until you sleep once.
* Equipment attribute that enhances your spells can now be stacked. The upper limit is still 3 times.
* Targetable spells will no longer gain experience for sandbagged and summoned enemies.
* Chance of that the equipment attribute that sometimes nullifies damage you take will activate is halved. Activation chance is now capped at 50%.
* Blacksmith shop now has maximum of about 100 items for sale. As invest level goes up, the chance of finding higher quality equipment at the shop will increase.
* Blackmarket shop now has maximum of about 20 items for sale. As invest level goes up, the chance of finding miracle level equipment at the shop increases.
* Harden level and blessed status of equipment for martial arts will no longer increase PV/DV, but increase damage modifier.
* Added claws, a new type of equipment. Like tonfas, claws are shields without the shield [PV] bonus.
* Added rocks, a new type of equipment. Damage is higher, but they are heavy, reduce DV, and reduce hit. Giants and Opatos will equip these.
* Doing a ranged attack (but not throwing attack) with a full gauge will proc an attack where the user approaches the target, uses Zero Shoot, then moves back into the AI's preferred distance from target.
** If the tile in the preferred distance from target cannot be moved into, then the user will move back into the tile where the gauge attack was activated. The higher the target's defence, and the longer the distance between the target and the user, the higher the pierce.
** Damage, however, is limited at 50% of the target's maximum health if the target has 50% or more health remaining.
* Gauge attack that procs when using a breath attack with a full gauge has been changed to Converge Breath. It has no element and will not damage allies. Damage depends on Control Magic and Constitution. Colour depends on user's resistances, but has no effect on the actual element.
** If the target's remaining HP is 50% or more of its maximum health, then the damage will be capped at 50% of the target's HP.
* When a rod is zapped or when casting a spell with a full gauge, an attack that affects all NPCs in sight will be used.
** Damage depends on Casting skill or Magic Device skill, whichever is higher. Will not hit allies. Will not be reflected by magic reflect.
** Damage is limited at 50% of target's maximum health if the target has 50% or more health remaining.
* You can now determine (albeit rather roughly) the level range of characters that you want when buying from the slave merchant and the horse merchant.
* Debuffs and buffs and their remaining number of turns can now be seen when 'l'ooking at NPCs.
* Greatly increased the selection of map tiles available on the house board. Almost all tiles without special characteristics can be chosen. Water tiles can now be placed even if you haven't bought a cyber house or a small castle.
* Miral and Garokk now have portraits. How cute.
* Probability that spells will not pass through friendly characters is now also reduced by the Magic Control of the friendly characters.
* Pets in visual range of the player are now targeted by the Directive special action by selecting them with the cursor *after* activation of the special action.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some descriptions.
* The player will no longer take part in Fire a volley if a pet uses it in the pet arena.
* Two Hand, Dual Wield, and Shield skill bonuses to their respective equipment will no longer be included in melee and throwing damage display.
* Fixed delivery quests getting generated when moving into another area under certain conditions.
* Highest damage dealt will no longer include damage dealt by an enemy NPC's suicide. The counter will be reset during the update.
* Fixed splitting monsters not getting any defence-related skill experience when receiving damage.
* The water tile didn't match the beach tiles, so they have been replaced with the old version of the tile and moved elsewhere.
* Fixed and added precautions against the crash that occurred when looking at the City Chart or town book added in 1.24.


==1.24==
'''8/4/2013'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added a new map to the Act III area. It's a town filled with dwarves with a problem on their hands.
* If the NPC interacted with is a pet, the "Attack" option will be at the bottom of the list below "Appearance".
* Characters will now have a random past [on their character sheet] to help bring life to them. It can be set during character creation (after picking an alias) or at the Deep-sea castle in South Tyris. It is possible to set it to secret even if you already have one. It will be secret by default and have nothing there. There aren't that many options now, but there will be more in the future.
* Placed sakura in full bloom on a map in Act III.
* Changed the names of several special actions and spells. The ones that are similar have been made consistent, and some that were kind of off have been changed.
* There will now only be up to 3 extra attacks from extra melee attack. (That makes it a total of 4 including the regular attack.) The greater the number of attacks and the greater the number of arms, the harder it is to proc more attacks. This is as many times as it will get, because the log and the animation would get too long.
* A special action that performed the same function as Attribute special action has been replaced. Half of maximum MP will be expended, and all enemies around you will get -50% gauge. Low chance to cause 1 turn of fear.
* Added the repeating bow, a type of crossbow.
* Some NPCs like the boar will now use Run Wildry on low health. During Run Wildry, Learning, Will, and Dexterity will be decreased, while Strength, Perception, and Speed will be increase. Swarm will also be used, and it will damage NPCs friendly to the user.
* Finally implemented the marshes of South Tyris which I've had on my mind.
* Pets will recover a large amount of HP when evolving.
* The special actions for each of the equipment types now affect all allies (including the player) in sight.
* Directive special action has been changed so that you can select a pet in sight with your cursor. Be careful, because if you don't specify a target, then it will automatically pick an NPC for you like when throwing items.
* Pets will now receive 10 times the experience to Cooking skill for the breakfast event introduced in 1.23.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed gauge attacks for staves doing twice as much damage as they were supposed to have.
* Fixed eating NPCs preventing you from using Cut Tree.
* Fixed equipment handed to pets getting equipped in the wrong slot.
* It was impossible to change the tone of all NPCs in all towns at once during the update, so they will change when you talk to them.
* List of pets will now display their correct sex if their sex has been changed.
* Fixed breakfast event occurring for pets who are below Fellow impress.
* Fixed the prostitution counter going up even when the player wasn't one of the parties involved. Prostitution counter will be reset during the update.
* Damage to the user from using Suicide will no longer be recorded in the journal for you and your pets. Highest damage inflicted record in the journal will be reset during the update.
* Fixed crimberries not getting used up when making crim ales in item fusion.
* Fixed the descriptions of some Awakened Nefia.


==1.23==
'''7/14/2013'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added Preaching special action.
** If it succeeds, you will receive alms from NPCs around you, and will give Faith skill experience to you and your pets.
** If the target NPCs' god is different from the one that you worship, then they will start worshipping your god instead, and you will receive bonus Faith experience.
** If your Faith skill is low, then rocks will be thrown at you.
** If the target is one of the 8 gods and they believed in a god other than themselves (which was possible in old versions), then they have the chance of converting.
** If the player preaches to the god that they believe in and if the preaching satisfies them, then they will have unique lines that expresses their embarrassment or their praise for you. Gotta convert 'em all!
* In Awakened Nefia, some floors will now give you periodic poison damage, or inflict gravity on you + have a ton of traps. In the future, there will be more kinds of floors like these that affect everyone, including the enemy, pets, and the player. These floors won't make any playstyle in particular impossible (e.g. melee, ranged, magic, pets, or magic device).
* Dungeon, Forest, Tower, and Fort random dungeons now have 1 new rare floor and wall patterns each. This is purely aesthetic.
* If you wake up from 4-9am and have a pet at Fellow impress or higher, then a breakfast event may occur. When eaten, it will increase all of the player's and all pets' potentials (including Luck) by a small amount that depends on the cook's Cooking skill. Everyone will become Satisfied. (Not bloated.)
** NB: Unspecified if this is Satisfied or Satisfied!.
* Various things will now be tracked in the journal. (Each of these things will be counted starting from this update.)
* Increased the chance of items appearing when digging walls. To balance it and also to make it make more sense, only Dungeon-type dungeons (NB: as opposed to Fort, etc) will now yield ores when the walls are dug. Only towns walls will yield gold pieces.
* Gauge attacks will now deal at most half of the target's maximum HP in damage. The damage is no longer affected by Brave feat, but it will still be affected by Fury.
* Gauge will increase to 95% at the most from damage received. In general, it is impossible to get counterattacked with a gauge attack immediately after attacking unless there is a large difference in Speed.
* Gauge of NPCs are now white when at 98% or above. (Indicates that they will use a gauge attack on their next turn.)
* Added crazy lines to a crazy NPC.
* Leveling up with 10 or more Axe skill will grant you the Cut Tree special action. Carrying a bardish or a certain chainsaw will allow you to cut trees to obtain wood material. wood material is cheap, but you can obtain lots of it at no cost. In the future, I'd like to make it possible to allow people to use these to craft wooden furniture via Carpentry.

 [Fixes]
* Some NPCs will no longer receive the bonus [levels] from Awakened Nefia and the Act III main quest dungeon.
* Fixed the bug with the feature that made adventurers bring out a weapon to replace the one that they had traded to you.


==1.22==
'''7/1/2013'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added a new evolution.
* Added the option to invest 50 ranks at a time. It is not cheaper than the regular option, because it uses the calculated sum of cost of investing the regular way. It trains Investing skill by a lot.
* Implemented the following equipment breaking features to No future mode only. Equipment has a chance of getting damaged when receiving a large amount of damage, causing its harden level to decrease. Acid damage can now also degrade equipment below -4. When the harden level goes below -10, the piece of equipment will be destroyed no matter what it was.
* Added the option to cancel when a command flag or the Directive special action is used.
* Implemented Nefia (NB: dungeon) awakening.
** You can receive an item from Leold after Act III has begun.
** When that item is used on the world map, all random Nefia in sight will be turned into Awakened Nefia.
** In an Awakenened Nefia, all NPCs aside from the boss will have the same level as the floor number, and non-unique NPCs will have 2 AP feats or 1 AP feat + magic reflect ability (albeit slightly weakened). Bosses are guaranteed to have the Brave and Obstinate feats.
** NPCs in Awakened Nefia cannot be Dominated, but monster balls can be used, and rare uniques will join you as pets after being defeated.
** This is just to have something that can pose a challenge to the player aside from the Void. Being unable to clear one of these dungeons will not be a problem.
** You will receive a special item when clearing one of these in the future, but the reward will be a number of small medals depending on the floor number for now.
* Main dungeon of Act III has been tentatively opened. NPCs in this dungeon aside from bosses will have the same level as the floor number. Dominate cannot be used here. You can go all the way to the mid-boss battle on the third floor. You'll probably find it difficult at this point because it's meant for players who have used artifact fusion.
* Added a Return point to the Act III map.
* Greatly increased the distance that needs to be travelled in order to start gaining skill experience from travelling. Increased experience gained per unit distance travelled.
* Investing in the baker will increase the number of items in each stack.
* Monsters from spellbook reading failure, from well quaffing, and from the equipment attribute that attracts monsters will now have the cIsSummoned bit flag, and will disappear after a few days.
* NPCs with the Pickpocket skill will now obtain a portion of the target's gold (capped at 2000 gp), with the amount depending on the skill level. Pickpocket experience will also be received. This is to make Pickpocket useful for NPCs.
* Added the {???} variable for custom lines.
* {npc} in custom lines will no longer have to be changed to {nptc}, and both are usable and interchangeable.
* Added the crimberry. It's a fruit that can be picked up in the wilderness, but cannot be used for cooking. When eaten, causes a slight sanity increase. Can be made into 10 crim ales via item fusion. Currently considering implementing the ability to make it into a drug.
* Added coffee. Reduces sleepiness by a small amount when drunk by the player. Removes sleep status when drunk by NPCs.
* Shadow Step is no longer prevented in the pet arena.
* When an identified weapon (both melee and ranged) is given to a pet, you can now choose which arm to equip it on. It will remain on this slot even in showrooms. If it is unidentified or if you choose to cancel, then it will be automatically equipped just like before.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some descriptions.
* Fixed NPCs at soul mate or above having the chance to attack the player when performing forced sleep sharing on them.
* Fixed the crash that occurred when receiving salary with no space in the salary chest (i.e. there are 401 or more items already in it).
* When updating to the previous version, the equipment attributes intrinsic to each material type disappeared from artifact equipment carried by the player. They will now be re-added to artifact equipment on the player when updating to 1.22.
* Male NPCs talked like females ones, so it will be fixed during the update to this version.
* Fixed some NPCs destroying walls even when on the world map.
* Fixed being unable to sell sacks of flour, eggs, and cooked items made from them after putting them into the cooler box. (This will not work for items that already exist.)


==1.21==
'''6/9/2013'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added new NPCs, and changed the sprites of some generic NPCs.
* Added 3 instruments. They might not be all useful, but they are rare.
* Changed the thief class feat to the below:
** [Ambush] Attacks on enemies who are not in combat will always be critical hits.
* Only ore items will now be separated from their stacks when selected during item fusion.
* The number of little sisters turned over and killed, as well as the number of rewards claimed will now be displayed in the journal.
** NB: Not for the English version at this point.
* Pets will be temporarily set to offense mode when they enter the pet arena. They will return to the battle mode they were on when they come out of the arena alive.
* Pets in defense mode with 2% or more in their gauge will now act to decrease the enemy's gauge while defending.
* Charge Attack will only boost attack power when used against an NPC that is hostile to you.
* Gauge will no longer increase when allied characters die.
* Receiving damage will no longer increase gauge beyond a certain point. Monster variants and uniques who are not pets have 5 times the normal HP, so their gauge increase caused by received damage will be 1/5.
** NB: Monsters with < > and { } around their names respectively.
* Greatly reduced weapon skill procs, and will now have less attack power compared to regular attacks before defence is factored into the damage calculation. On the other hand, there will be bonus damage depending on average harden level (NB: + value) of all items equipped (if above 20, then it will be 20).
* Fury and the Brave feat no longer affect weapon skill proc damage.
** NB: Brave feat was an AP feat that increased damage done on strong enemies. Replaced with a feat that dealt more damage when HP is reduced; English feat name remains unchanged.
* Weapon skill procs will only be used by the following characters now. All characters will still gain gauge % points, but it will not be displayed for characters not in the list below.
** The player.
** Pets (their gauge is displayed only if they have been auscultated with a stethoscope).
** Characters level 130 and above before reaching Act III.
** Characters level 50 and above after Act III is reached.
** All characters in No future mode.
* The tamer's whip can now be used on non-hostile NPCs. The following can then be selected from a list:
** Prohibit/allow eating/drinking off the ground
** Prohibit/allow picking up of ores
** Change tone of speech (make little girls talk like males, or make dogs meow, etc)
** Have them whip you instead
* Whipping others or getting whipped repeatedly and causing a variable to go beyond a certain value will cause the flavour text to be different. The former will use txtDiscipline2, and the latter will use txtInsult2. Feel free to edit those if the current ones aren't to your liking. If the character being whipped has a wooden horse at their feet, then the variable increases twice as fast.
* If the player uses the Squeeze special action when sleepy, and there is a king's bed, double bed, or happy bed at his feet, you can pull the target on to the bed. It may fail if the player does not have enough impress with the target or enough Strength.
** When it succeeds, forced sleep sharing is initiated. The effects differ depending on the impress that the NPC had towards the player at the beginning.
** All that happens is that the player and target sleep on the same bed. Really. If the flavour text displayed in reaction to the event, then feel free to edit txtMidNight.
** The sleep event begins without any turn delay if it succeeds, regardless of whether the target is an enemy or an ally.
** However, sleeping like this will not increase potential.
* Added an item that allows inheritance of a pet. It can be acquired at souvenir vendors and via Tailoring, and so on. In order to use it,
** 1. the target must be a pet at Soul Mate or above.
** 2. press F8 when you have the pet with you, then save a showroom. (You don't have to upload it.)
** 3. make a gene with the item in your inventory.
** 4. after incarnating the gene, use the item on the pet in your showroom to make it join you.
** You can use as many of these items on the same pet as you like at step 1. (As insurance for when you lose it.)
** However, only the last one to be used will have an effect. It cannot be overwritten, so the older ones cannot be used.
** You will need to save with the most recent item used at step 2.
** In addition to that, all equipment, attributes (NB: sic), and AP will be lost, and attributes and skills will be greatly decreased.
** The point of this be able to start a new game with a pet who is dear to you.
** I've tested it and it works, but this is the first time I've done something to affect multiple save files so there may be something wrong with it.
** Please backup your save file before using this feature.
* To buff useless pet skills as well as crafting with materials, pets at Friend status or above with Mining, Fishing, Gardening, Gene engineer, or Detection skills will now gather an amount of material (depending on their skill levels) while adventuring.
** When they have accumulated a certain amount of it, there will be an option to receive materials from them when talking to them.
** The speed of material gathering and the type of materials gathered are subject to further balancing.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some descriptions.
* Fixed crossbows using the blunt weapon skill proc when fired.
* Fixed pets in the pet arena who were in offence mode not attacking the enemy after reaching their respective set distances from the target.
* Fixed gauge becoming 0 when attacking with a scythe at 100% gauge.
* Fixed robbery sleep event resulting in no losses when event skip is not on in the config.
** NB: Probably refers to Malicious Hand sleep event.
* Fixed the effect of the special action that allows for usage of magic devices without using the turn.
* Fixed being able to fish in lava tiles.


==1.20==
'''5/19/2013'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Currently focusing on development on Act III. Added one new map to the new area. Its residents are rather... weird. Travel between North Tyris and the new area will be implemented after all the new towns have been finished.
* Added new artifacts and NPCs.
* Added a special action that allows the usage of a magic device once per turn without expending a turn.
* Implemented the effects of Jure of Healing's trademark special action.
* If you don't have any unpaid bills, then you will be more likely to receive additional items in your salary. The probability of the increase in number of items depends on the tax amount. If there are unpaid bills, then there will be fewer items.
* If you don't have any unpaid bills, then the quality of items received in your salary will be increased. Higher quality items and expendable goods will be generated.
* The quartermaster feats (which made miracle-quality equipment have a higher chance of getting generated in salary) was too useless, so its effect has been tripled, and there will be slightly more herbs.
* Salary items will come blessed/cursed depending on whether bills are paid or not.
* Level requirement for the generation of some items has been increased.
* Healing items and healing spells will now recover at least 2% of the target's maximum HP.
* Race and class name is now customizable during character creation.  (It's a superficial change; you can enter a custom race/class after picking an existing one from the list.)
* Ranged weapons can now be equipped in your hands, and you can beat things up with the gunstock, stones, or panties. Melee weapons can also be equipped in the ranged slot, so you can throw daggers, spears, hand axes, and stuff at enemies
** The former relies on Blunt skill and the damage dice is halved. Firearms and bows will also have reduced fixed damage and will not have any bonuses from the ammo.
** The latter relies on Throwing skill, and the range multipliers aren't as good. The weapon skills unique to each melee weapon type will also not proc.
** If the character has no hands or has empty hands but has a weapon equipped in the ranged slot, the weapon in the ranged slot will be picked to block weapon skill procs. (But if the character also has a weapon in their hand, then that weapon will be used to try to block the weapon skill proc.)
** If a shield is equipped in the range slot, there will be no shield PV multiplier, and it will not block Shield Bash.
** If you hand a piece of equipment to a pet, you will be able to choose which slot to equip the equipment to. Melee weapons will get equipped in the ranged slot if you pick the ranged slot or if the hands are full.
* When in the desert, getting lost and confusion will occur frequently. Stamina will also decrease rapidly during the day in the desert.
* If there is space in your inventory, then items chosen during item fusion will be removed from their stack. (This makes it possible to pick the same stack of items multiple times.)
* Ores can now be fused into pretty gems.
* Adjusted power of weapon skill procs. They no longer proc randomly and require more than 6/7 health. Instead, the weapon skill will automatically proc when the power gauge below the HP bar reaches 100%.
** The gauge decreases by 1% every turn, and resets to 0% when changing maps.
** Performing a physical attack or dealing damage to the target will cause it to increase by 2%.
** Getting attacked will also increase it depending on the damage received. (If it is evaded or does 0 damage, gauge will increase by 1%.)
** Both the attacker's and the target's gauges will be increased only by the first attack that occurs until the next turn. As such, Continuous attacks special action and receiving many attacks from different characters will not cause the gauge to increase rapidly.
** When a character defeats someone, all other characters in sight that are on the same side as that character will have their gauge increased by 5%.
** When a character dies, all other characters in sight that are on the same side as that character will have their gauge increased by 10%.
** The above applies if the attacker and the dead character were on different sides.
** Subject to balance.
* The feat that increased chance of shield bashing has been changed to increase the chance of causing additional effects when shield bashing.
* Added a new special action that allows you to hug the target.
** If impress is 100 or above, if the target's HP is not full, then the player will give 1/10 of his HP to the target.
** If impress is 200 or above, then txtHug custom line will also be activated, and brainwash will be removed.
** If impress is below 100 or if the user is an NPC, then the target will be squeezed and damage dependent on Strength will be dealt.
** That means you can hug any enemy to death even if it's the final boss.
* The equipment that NPCs generated with were too weak, so their weapon and shield will started off hardened (except for artifacts and lightsabres) by an amount depending on their level. In general, it will be +1 at level 30 and +10 at level 300.
* Flying scrolls will no longer change equipment stats, and will only change weight.
* Critical damage multiplier increases from x1 to x3, depending on twice the weight of the melee weapon. (For martial arts, this is 1/40 of the Martial Arts skill.) If the target's total equipment weight is above 15s, then the multiplier is reduced depending on the weight.
* If the weapon is 4.0s or below (2.0 for Martial Arts), then the lighter the weapon, the higher the likelihood of doing a critical attack. (Chance increases every 0.01s in weight.) Critical rate remains the same for weapons heavier than 4.0s.
* Doubled the evade rate from DV. Halved the effect of Perception on evade.
* Skill experience from Traveling has been somewhat reduced. Not much will be given for traveling short distances, but quite a bit will be given for long distances.
* Added "Intercept" directive to the command flag and to the Directive special action. Pets in intercept mode will not attempt to hunt down enemies beyond a certain distance from the player (distance is the range of Cheer). If they are outside this range, moving back into range of the player will be of higher priority for them than fighting enemies. (If an enemy blocks their path back to the player, they will fight.)

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some descriptions.
* Fixed stave weapons not having damage bonus for their weapon skill proc.
* Fixed pet's action prioritization after purchasing increased frequency of melee/ranged with AP.
* Fixed sex being wrong after evolution. Female, Female?, and bisexual NPCs will use female evolutions. Male, Male?, and genderless NPCs will use male evolutions.


==1.19==
'''04/29/2013'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added one new type of NPC.
* When brainwashed, you will space out and be unable to change your equipment.
* Vanish special action will no longer work in the arena, pet arena, and showrooms.
* Elemental breaths will now deal bonus damage if the user has enough resistance in that same element.
* Changed damage dealt by Mani's gem stone of satellite shooter and made it no longer hit the user.
* There will now be a sound effect that plays when receiving starvation damage.
* Spell potential is now displayed on the spell list.
* Reduced magic stock consumption to about 1/3.
* Cost of spellbooks is now about 1/2.
* Removed the 1% increase in spell potential when a spellbook is successfully read.
* Spell potential now increases by 20% for all spells except those without stock.
* Skill trainers will now recover 20% in skill potential regardless of current potential.
* Melee weapons other than scythes will now invoke a special attack, and the damage of the special attack depends on the weapon skill level.
** (They were supposed to be invokes like decapitation, but there's a limit on number of invokes.)
** Probability that the special attack will proc is low and depends on weapon skill level, and will only occur at most once per turn.
** When activated, the txtSpecial custom line will be used.
** It will not proc unless the user's HP is above 6/7 of the maximum.
** Like decapitation, it will ignore a part of defence, and regular Evasion will not work against it, but if the target character has a weapon equipped in the dominant hand, it can be negated. Probability of negation depends on the target's Greater Evasion.
** Even if it is not completely negated, the power will be reduced by Greater Evasion skill level.
** Some weapons in the same category of weapons have different special attacks, but the damage and probability of activation all depend on their respective weapon skill levels.
** (dagger and kitchen knife will use the short sword special attack, while wakizashi and scimitar will use the long sword special attack even though they are all in the Short Sword category. As such, all of these weapons' special attack will depend on the Short Sword skill level.)
* In addition to the above change, some warrior-type NPCs now start off with certain weapons (e.g. minotaur will now spawn wielding a bardish with Two Hand).
* Buffed power of Shield Bash by quite a bit. But if the target has a shield equipped, the damage is reduced by the target's Shield and Greater Evasion skill levels. The additional effects of Shield Bash will not be negated. It will also no longer activate if the user's HP is above 6/7 of maximum. If a tonfa is equipped, a different special attack will be used.
* Custom lines can now be used with the player. (Because of how it works, a lot of the tone variables are useless.)
* Changed the effects of eating a forbidden meat. If blessed, it changes sex from male to female or vice versa. Regular forbidden meat changes sex to male? or female?. If cursed, it will change sex to bisexual or genderless at random.
** NB: Terms used are in Elona+ 1.57; it wasn't working in the english version at this point.
* The human unique NPCs in Act III were way too weak, so some of them have been given artifact equipment to start off with.
* If base resistance is above 200 (Normal), resistance will no longer increase when food that increases resistance is eaten.
* Magic resistance of new characters was either 100 or 150 at generation, so it will not be 100 to 200 depending on their starting level. (The increase starts at level 51, and is at the maximum at level 300.) Characters who start off with magic resistance by default will now have 200 regardless of what their level is.
* Leold can now prevent pets from using magic or special actions for 20AP.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed sex change having no effect on conversations.
* Fixed Mani's gem stone of satellite shooter's description so that it says it deals lightning damage.
* Fixed the problem with conversations with Arcbelc's citizens.
* Fixed the crash that occurred when entering a farm without Gardening skill.
* Fixed the crash that occurred when slaughtering livestock on the ranch without Anatomy skill.
* Fixed being able to indefinitely duplicate composts. Compost in old versions is now grass. New farms will now come with 5 compost tiles.
* Weapons that have their name changed will now have their name displayed properly when they are wielded proudly.
* Fixed being unable to talk to some unique NPCs after clearing their sub quest if you have entered Amur-Cage.
* Experience will no longer be received when furniture is thrown at yourself, at NPCs spawned from splitting, or from summoned NPCs.
* Fixed the activation requirement for cut damage to the attacker equipment attribute.
* Changed void enemy cycle.


==1.18R==
'''04/17/2013'''
 [Changes and additions]
* NB: 1.18fix (04/17/2013) is listed on the wiki but not in the changelog file. Its changelog is a subset of 1.18R's.
* Decreased level, number, and spawn rate of wild animals on farms.
* Removed the wild animal flag from some monsters.
* Adjusted probability of a new seedling growing on the tile after harvest. The probability is higher on farm tiles, and lower on other tiles.
* Portraits of NPCs will no longer change after sex change.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some descriptions.
* organic fertilizer is no longer usable on non-farm tiles.
* corn and imo will no longer rot.
* Fixed the bug in the conditions for triggering use of special actions learned through evolution.
* Fixed the issue with the void bosses.
* Fixed the sprite change of ranged weapons.
* Fixed pets at *love* status not getting a boost when rubbed.
* Increased the nutritional value of food eaten by cute fairy and goose that is required for them to produce their items.


==1.18==
'''04/14/2013'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Currently focusing on development of Act III. Added one new map to the new area. It's not a town, but a place where you can meet unique NPCs who have died. Travel between North Tyris and the new map will be implemented when all the towns have been finished.
* It would be weird if NPCs that you have defeated but aren't supposed to be dead get placed in the aforementioned map. Cradle of Chaos bosses also can't be placed there because they don't get marked as defeated when you kill them. NPCs like these are instead used as candidates for the void bosses, and are added to the list as you progress in the main quest.
* Added new NPCs.
* Added txtChargeS (line used when the user starts Charge Attack) and txtChargeA (line used when attacking with a charged Charge Attack) to the custom lines. txtCharge which was introduced some time ago is the line used in reaction to an ally using Charge Attack.
* {me} variable in custom lines that lets the user use the appropriate term to refer to himself can now be used.
* Added some new vegetables and fruits.
* Vegetable and fruit quality increases with Gardening skill. Price of high-quality crops is greatly increased, and the effect from eating it is also somewhat increased.
* Added organic fertilizer item. It can only be used at the seedling stage before the plant is fully grown. It will make the plant grow instantly into the harvestable stage, and also increases the quality of crops if the plant is a vegetable or fruit plant. An organic fertilizer is generated when a food item (only the type that rots) or organic waste (shit, straw, etc) is placed on the compost on the farm for about a week.
* Wild animals will now randomly spawn on farm deeds. The lower the Gardening skill, the lower their chance of spawning. They will get in the way of your gardening but they won't eat your crops or anything.
* Corpse weight does not affect its price as much now.
* Anatomy skill increases corpse quality from killing monsters bred on the ranch. Price of high-quality corpses is increased, and effect from eating it is also increased.
* New special action: Rubbing. You aren't limited to petting your pets; you can rub wild animals and NPCs in the town to your heart's content.  If impress and Dexterity are low, the target will get angry. If impress is high, then it causes 1 turn of boost. For NPCs at soul mate or above, the txtNade custom line is triggered. If you have a livestock brush with you and the target of Rubbing is a livestock, then you will brush the livestock. Livestock that have been brushed before and haven't been brushed in a while will flock towards the player.
* Implemented April fools. NPCs in every town will tell lies during conversation in the 4th month. The lies will range from ones that are obviously ridiculous to the fairly believable. Quest dialogue, conversation with unique NPCs, and NPCs in certain towns are unaffected.
* <Garokk> the legendary smith can change the name, appearance, and description of an item for 5 platinum pieces. Place the text file and sprite in the user/item folder; there can be up to 15 sets of custom items. Fishing rod and gifts cannot be altered. Note: the item and description can be reverted to the original, but the sprite cannot be reverted due to the limit of the parameter.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some descriptions.
* Fixed the effect of the feat from the secret treasure of Ehekatl.


==1.17fix==
'''03/30/2013'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Items like furniture will give Tactics and Throwing skill experience when thrown.
* The feature introduced in 1.17 that allowed for the addition of body parts now has an upper limit of 15. Torso parts can now be added.

 [Fixes]
* Changed some description.
* Fixed NPCs strung up on a sand bag dying.
* Fixed txtwelcome in custom NPC lines not functioning.
* Fixed item limit in No future mode.


==1.17==
'''03/24/2013'''
 [Changes and additions]
* doctor <Gavela> can now add limbs for pets and the player at the cost of Life. Flavour text-wise, he's not transplanting or growing limbs, but giving you prosthetic arms and legs or a brace. Pets who have their number of limbs increased this way will not confer new limbs to other pets when fused to them during gene engineering. (You can, however, just add limbs directly to them.)
* After finishing <Icolle> the biologist's sub quest, the number of limbs that pets and the player has can be returned to original. If Life is 2 or above, then it will be decreased by 1 every time his service is used. Be warned, however, that mutants do not gain new limbs above a certain level, so be careful about resetting their body parts.
* After finishing <Icolle> the biologist's sub quest, the gene machine will now be available from the list of rewards for the Little sister sub quest.
* Split the {npc} variable in NPCs' speech into {npcc} and {nptc}. The former is the name of the character that executed the action, and the latter is the target of that action. Some of the NPC's talk lines have different targets, so use these in those situations.
* Only hostile NPCs and spirits will gain the IsSummoned bit flag when summoned.
* Visitors to your house stopped leaving, so NPCs with the IsSummoned bit who are neutral or above will also leave the map after some time has passed.
* You can't throw kitty banks owned by other people any more, so kitty banks can now be broken by bashing them.
* Splitting monsters that split even when they have a negative status effect will now need to receive more than 1/10 of their maximum HP in order to split. (It used to be 1/20 max HP in damage or 10% chance at random.)
* NPCs other than pets will now use Lay Hand and Absolute protect on characters who are also hostile against the same group of characters. Cheer will now only affect characters who are hostile against the same group of characters.
* Changed pets' reaction when trying to take away handmade chocolate given to them.
* Added two game modes that can be chosen when starting the game. Current game mode is displayed on the character sheet.
** Advancing mode: mode that focuses on levelling and achieving things the legitimate way. The default.
** No future mode: players will face all sorts of dangers and limitations. For the stoic.
*** There will be a penalty when starting up the game if the game was not exited the last time with Esc or Shift+S. (Includes terminating the program.)
*** The player is forced to crawl up after dying.
*** Number of items the player can carry has a lower limit.
*** All items on the player is dropped upon death. (Even when on a map that is randomly generated.)
*** Large karma loss for killing cats and dog. (Even if hostile.)
*** Impress of NPCs killed will lower.
*** When impress is below a certain limit, the NPC will attack occasionally, including citizens and even your pets.
*** Score is multiplied by 20 when clearing the game. (Doesn't do anything.)
*** Etc.
* Edited readme and readme_ENG
* Changed the attribute changes for some monster evolutions.
* Added a potion that prevents food that it has been mixed with from rotting.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some descriptions.
* Fixed the equipment attributes that can be chosen for living ranged weapons.
* Fixed Kumiromi of Harvest's unique skill being usable after recruiting him as a pet.
* Fixed some unique artifacts not having their equipment attributes reduced.


==1.16==
'''3/10/2013'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Currently focusing on development of Act III. Added a new town to the new map. Travel between North Tyris and the new map will be implemented later.
* Added new NPCs.
* Increased physical damage bonus from Will.
* Capped desire for violence feat damage modifier at 100. Changed the drawback of the feat from reduced DV to increased received damage (modifier for damage received is 1/4 of modifier for damage done).
* You will be punished for wasting chestnuts if you throw more than 100 chestnuts. (This is fairly dangerous if you're not strong enough.)
* Cost of Zero shoot special action has been doubled, and it now has a multiplier comparable to Two Hand's.
* Living weapons will no longer gain equipment attributes depending on their name, and you now have some control over what type of equipment attribute they gain. For now, the equipment attribute they gain is chosen at random from the category. It will never suck blood up to level 10, and it is guaranteed to gain blood sucking at level 11 and onwards. The highest level is 15, so you will have to choose if you want to stop at level 10 or have a level 15 blood sucking weapon.
* scroll of name is now randomly generated.
* Furniture, junk, trees, and so on can now be (T)hrown. Tools and water sources like wells are exceptions. Damage it will do depends on Throwing skill and weight of object thrown. If the item is heavy and you do not have enough Weight Lifting skill, you will be unable to throw it. The thrown item will not be consumed, and will drop at the target's feet. If it misses, it will be whereever it lands.
* Consolidated Cure of Jua animation, and made its additional effects depend on how pious you are.
* BakuretuKen AP special action is now a Tactical ability that also comes with Attribute and Clear Mind special actions.
* Attribute special action now imbues attacks with only the element that the user has the highest resistance against. Greatly buffed its power and duration. Makouken, which works the same way, will be changed to a new martial arts special action in the future.
* Stayers on the discarded ranch can now be moved. Item limit is now 400.
* Eye of Mind skill has been changed from Perception to Will.
* {you}, {sex}, {player}, {aka}, {npc}, {onii}, and {syujin} variables can now be used in custom lines aside from txtDialog (which is used in conversations). The NPC's tone can also be changed with {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, {}, and {}
* Added ability to customize lines used during Synchro hearts.
* Monsters with the IsSummoned bit flag that are strung up with a sand bag, as well as NPCs that are neutral or above will no longer disappear.
* Servants, the eight gods, as well as some other NPCs (Jure fanatic, <Gilbert> the carnel, etc) now start off worshipping a certain god. The god that other NPCs worship will no longer depend on the map they are on, and is now completely random. There will be a way to change the god that NPCs worship in the future.
* Browbeat was way too strong, so damage reduction has been changed from 75% to 50%.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed several descriptions.
* Fixed a variable getting stuck when Zero shoot special action is used with Throwing.
* Monsters on the ranch, students in the doujou, and NPCs on the discarded ranch will no longer move around at random when strung up on a sand bag.

 [Changes and additions]
* NB: 1.1555 (02/23/2013) is listed on the wiki but not in the changelog file. No changelog exists for it.
* After clearing all events at the Maid house, a deed of discarded ranch can be bought from the same NPC (for 500k gp). You can leave pets at the discarded ranch.
* Monsters on the ranch, students at the Doujou, and NPCs waiting at the discarded ranch no longer do anything other than move around. (This is to make the game run faster.)
* Removed upper limit of special training cost at the Doujou.
* Revamped requirement for earning AP.
* Monsters summoned from summon spells or special actions, ragnarok, splitting, or birthed from pregnancy will have the summoned bit flag. Monsters with this bit flag will disappear during map refresh or with the passage of time.
* Changed where SP is displayed.
* Feats acquired with AP are now displayed in the Feats tab.
* Made breath attacks slightly more powerful.
* A certain sub quest will now recover luck potential and give some luck experience.
* Changed portraits. Some of the generic NPCs' faces have changed, the goddess of healing now blushes, Pael's mom (human form) looks like she's on the brink of death, and so on.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed special actions and feats being unacquirable with AP.
* Fixed a bug in the cap of number of undead that can be summoned from coffin of necromancy.
* Implemented an AP deviation counter. If you're worried about it even though you don't remember having acquired any AP from other methods, refund your AP before upgrading to this version. If you do this, even if you have more AP than you should, it will just be deducted from your current AP.
** It will calculate the AP that you should have based on number of turns, starting attributes calculated from the level at which the pet joined you, then determine the sum of the attributes. Characters with abnormally high AP considering the starting attributes and current attributes, or with with abnormally high speed (that cannot be reached even with hermes blood spam) will gain a bit flag that will have negative effects in future versions.
** If you figure out how the threshold is determined, please don't spread it.  If people start being able to guess what the threshold is, the requirements will be made stricter in the next version.


==1.155==
'''02/17/2013'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added a new type of NPC.
* Added a new type of evolution.
* Lowered the power of Shield Bash by quite a bit. When shield + weapon is equipped, there will be a Shield skill-dependent multiplier on attack power (lower than the one for Two Hand).
* Changed and fixed the guaranteed starting equipment attribute on equipment. The amount of skill bonus is they give is ##.
* If the existing strength of equipment attribute is below a certain value, the strength of additional equipment attributes will not get halved.
* Adjusted probability that a special action learned with AP will be used.
* crab race has been combined with hermit crab race into shell race. The attributes and special actions of that race are more or less their respective bests of the two former races.
* phantom race has been combined with the ghost race. Attributes and special actions are respective bests of the old races.
* New zanan and karune extra races. Assigned existing human NPCs to those races where appropriate.
* Charge Attack is no longer interrupted when receiving attacks. It will be interrupted if a status effect is received. However, it will last for only 1 turn for the player and 3 turns for NPCs. It will now also work for dart-type spells, bolt-type spells, ball-type spells, and breath special actions.
* When Charge Attack is used, pets have a chance of talking. (Line is customizable.)
* Added some explanation to the readme.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed special actions bought with AP getting refunded when they are used.
* Fixed restore body/mind having no effect on unique NPC pets.
* Fixed SP display colour being affected by status effects.
* Made Zero Shoot work properly.


==1.15==
'''02/15/2013'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Currently focusing on development of Act III. Added a new town to the new map. Travel between North Tyris and the new map will be implemented later.
* Added quite a few new NPCs.
* Added a ranged special action. It might be a bit too powerful.
* Increased frequency and power of Shield Bash.
* Tonfas will no longer give the Shield skill-dependent PV modifier. (The PV on the tonfa itself will still count, and if you equip one together with a shield, the Shield skill PV modifier will be active). Tonfas will also no longer lower the player's cast rate when equipped. (It will still lower Martial Arts accuracy like a shield and activate Shield Bash from time to time.)
* Added 3 evolutions and changed 1 evolution.
* Added 1 type of food to the tree nut category which had only the api nut in it. You can do more than eat it...
* Changed and added AP abilities. Some new tactical abilities will now change the user's behaviour depending on the enemy, the user, and the player. Another new ability can change the element of the user's attacks depending on the user's resistances.
* The "_____ breath" description makes it sound like the attack is coming from the mouth. Changed it to "______ discharge" for roleplaying purposes. (So that you can have fire tornadoes coming out of your chest or lightning from your fingertips.)
** NB: This change does not affect the English version.
* Increased dice roll of breaths and Drain Blood. Damage from the former non-elemental breath can now be mitigated with magic resistance. SP recovery from Drain Blood is now 2.
* Tentatively added starting equipment attributes for all types of equipment (except artifacts). There are 95 types of equipment, so there may be some overlap. There should be no overlap within each category though. Use this in early game to help with the low skill levels and resistances.
* Prayer of Jure now gives Holy Veil, Vanquish Hex, and Regeneration.
* Increased range of Mana Burst.
* You can have up to 10 coffin of necromancy undead plus pets. You can swamp enemies by summoning new ones to replace any that die. When summoned undead die, they will return to their coffin and can only be used after 24 hours.
* Reverted the cost of Cheer, and removed the healing effects.
* Removed the immediate SP recovery and Healing skill boost from Regeneration. Regeneration will now recover HP every turn. (SP recovery does not occur every turn.)
* The bug affecting the equipment attribute that invokes Shadow Step was too hard to fix, and it was too strong even after fixing it, so it's now replaced by Feather invoke. (Shadow Step invoke was the same rank as Holy Shield invoke, so replacing it with Feather should be fair.)
* Changed special action learned during evolution by golden knight from Clear Mind to Super Armor. Super Armor has also been given dim resistance to make it super armor-ish.
* Current SP and maximum SP are now displayed.
* General vendors sell kit of making chocolate in February. When used, up to 3 chocolates can be made in a year. Depending on the steps that you take, items other than chocolate can be created. These chocolates can be handed to NPCs other than your pets, so feel free to use them to increase impress. If their impress is low, they will refuse the chocolate and you will be sad. Alternatively, you can melt the chocolate, lather yourself in it, then present yourself as a gift. People will more or less find this disgusting. When on low health, you may also die due to fire damage.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed some NPCs not throwing potions like they were supposed to. aqua sanctio and disaster high potions are no longer unique artifacts.
* Touch of Weakness, cursed potions of restore mind/body, and high potion of disaster will no longer decrease attributes when thrown at unique NPCs. Damage and status effects will now occur like they should. (This is a feature from vanilla Elona, except that it increased attributes instead of decreasing them like it should.)
* Fixed some descriptions of items and spells.


==1.14==
'''01/14/2013'''
 [Changes and additions]
* NB: This version is listed on the official wiki as 1.14-1 but as 1.14 in the changelog file.
* Currently focusing on development of Act III. Added 1 new town to a new map. The player can now travel between South Tyris and the new map. Travel between North Tyris and the new map will be implemented later.
* If you die on a map that is not your home and choose to crawl up, you will not return home, and the place you will revive at will depend on the map you are on.
* Added some evolutions.
* Added quite a few new NPCs.
* +3 more starting Tactics skill for warmage.
* Resistances that NPCs start with are now halfway between 1.13 and versions prior to 1.13.
* Increased all elemental damage calculation. Grenade damage was outstripping everything so that has been reduced.
* Revamped the 3 types of potion throwing because their repertoire were mostly the same. One of them now specializes in status effect potions, another in debuffs, and the third in damage potions.
* Reduced high potion of aqua sanctio damage and added it as one of the potions thrown by potion throwing. Reduced materials required to craft it.
* Chance of a potion of evolution getting generated is now 10 times higher than what it was. It is now somewhat easier to find than hermes blood.
* Removed the halving of PV from heavy, medium, and light armour, and implemented a cap of 300. It's unlikely that you would reach that cap through normal play.
* Changed calculation for maximum HP and MP. Will, Learning, and level now have a greater effect on them. The limit for max HP/MP has also been raised.
* Current HP and MP are now listed on the character sheet. (This also applies to pets, of course.) It is listed above the Life value.
* A maximum of 2 AP feats can be acquired. If you have 3 or more AP feats, the AP will be fully refunded to you when you upgrade to this version. (It can exceed the AP limit.)
* AP special actions and feats can be forgotten without having to have enough AP to buy it. 100% of the AP spent will be refunded.
* Changed condition for Barrier feat activation to "100% of the time when current MP is more than 1/3 of maximum".
* Increased magic reaction from Mana Burst, and area of effect is now everything in field of vision. It will pass through non-hostile NPCs most of the time as long as the user has Control Magic.
* Doubled SP cost for Cheer, and also made it recover 20% of the target's HP and MP.
* In addition to recovering additional SP over time, Regeneration will now also recover 5 SP the moment it comes into effect.
* Contingency will now cause the received damage to be 0 instead of making the damage heal you. It will now wear off after coming into effect once.
* There are reports that the strength of enemies on each floor of the void was weird after the change in 1.13, so the monster level calculation has been reverted for testing.
* It wasn't fair that anorexia did less damage the stronger the target was, so it now does more damage depending on the target's Constitution. It is still faster to train yourself up and beat up the target though.


==1.13==
'''12/25/2012'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Currently focusing on development of Act III. You can enter the new map (it's not finished and there's nothing in it), but please backup your save file before that. If you enter that map, you won't be able to exit the map except by dying (a la Dragon Quest game over Zoom). If you do that, however, the quest bugs up, so you will have to restart from a backup.
* Added some evolutions.
* Added some new monsters.
* Changed level of monsters in the void. In vanilla Elona, the void bosses had an extra modifier to their level depending on the floor they are on, so they would be far stronger compared to the other monsters on the same floor. That has been fixed, and there is now a cap on boss level.
* When naming NPCs, you can enter up to 20 characters.
* Attribute experience will no longer have pet and Learning bonuses (the change from 1.11).
* Allies and enemies will no longer teleport when casting spells during Dim or Confused status.
* Removed auto-save after gene engineering.
* Blessing and hardening armour will now increase DV in addition to PV.
* Potions of weaken resistance were too strong, so their effect has been changed to Element Scar + Nightmare.
* Starting resistances of NPCs have been raised.
* Fire damage is good against undead but may cause fires and does less damage on wet targets. Cold damage has the drawback of causing item destruction. Taking these two points into account, targets that receive fire damage will take increased damage for 1 turn, while targets that receive cold damage will receive less damage for 1 turn. Fire/cold damage have a high chance of causing the above side-effects, and are unpreventable like paralysis from lightning damage, and does not accumulate. Slightly increased fire- and cold-elemental spells.
* Halved the PV from light, medium, and heavy armour.
* Increased damage calculation for Fire a volley.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed pets at the doujou having their resistances gained from food reset when taking them out of the doujou.
* Fixed souvenir vendors causing item parameters to become bugged.


==1.12R==
'''11/25/2012'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Currently focusing on development of Act III... please wait a while longer. It will display as "in development" in the journal.
* Added and changed evolutions.
* Added quite a few NPCs. Can you find them all? Watch out for the new thieves.
* Changed some sprites.
* Gave innate dark resistance to bat race.
* Greatly reduced the chance of getting 1 turn of paralysis when receiving lightning damage.
* If you are affected by paralysis, confusion, blind, dim, or sleep status effects and you receive an attack that causes that same status effect, the received status effect will not add to the number of turns of your existing status effect.
* Being bisexual and so on will now affect conversations.
* Enemies in the void now cycle every 200 levels instead of every 50 level. This should prevent high level enemies from appearing where they shouldn't.
* Monster clusters with an extreme level difference will no longer generate. Some types of monsters that never generated together in a cluster will now generate in them.
* Cursed rods of slow and potions of slow will increase weight when used on the player or pets.
* Eternal force will now change the terrain.
* Life of behicle race has been changed from 170 to 120. horse race has 150 life and 125 speed so this should make it fair.
* When an NPC in sight does a critical attack, the critical sound effect is played.
* Postponed the time when Leold will leave Ruoza. If you have already started on that part of the quest in 1.12, he should not be gone from Ruoza as long as you didn't enter that map in that version.
* NB: version 1.12 is the version before 1.12R, but no changelog exists for it.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed when Swimming experience is given.
* Fixed the blue icon for defending pets moving to the left together with the HP bar.
* There was a mistake in the calculation for Gwen's level, making her a bit too pitiless.
* Fixed pets getting their resistances gained from food reset when they are left in the doujou.
* Fixed main quest event vanishing without a trace when you talk to the captain in Port Kapul.


==1.11==
'''10/21/2012'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added just the opening of Act III main quest.
* Added 2 types of new NPCs.
* Made pet skills gain 4 times as much experience as the player's. Adjusted rate of potential increase during training.
* Added Forced draft special action unique to guards. When the player gets hit by this, is a criminal, is not disguised, and has low HP, he gets taken to the jail.
* If the player is not a criminal, the jail door immediately opens.
* Made slight changes to the absolute defender's (NB: evolved defender) signature special action. When it is in effect, when allies receive damage that is greater than their respective HPs, that damage is negated and the absolute defender receives half of it.
* Changed special action learned during evolution by android from Rampage to Fire a volley.
* Adjusted defence and evade bonus from Obstinate feat because the multipliers were too high.
* SP recovery rate during Regeneration is increased.
* When Drain Blood is used on the player, SP will also be stolen. (5-10 points per use.) If the player uses Drain Blood, the cost is deducted from the amount gained, so it will recover 5 points.
* Adjusted equipment stat changes from using flying scrolls.
* Implemented a regional cap for the rank of monster ambushes encountered.
* Sandbagged NPCs will not receive any experience.
* Stealth criticals will not proc against sandbagged NPCs.
* Adjusted rate and range of pet enemy detection. Enemies targeted by the player are also made a priority.
* Adjusted prioritization of attacks when increased frequency of melee or ranged are bought with AP. If both of them have been bought, then they will be used with equal frequency.
* Changed the BGM of some static dungeons.
* Dungeons bought with deed of dungeon will always come with a summoning crystal! What a great buy!
* The doujou, Larna, and Ruoza will now periodically refresh.
* Added just a few lines to Lune the maid.
* There will be a blue icon on the top-left corner of the HP bars of pets who are in defence mode.
* predator class will start off with bonus Throwing skill.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed <Awesome Swimwear> event. If the swimwear is currently equipped or is marked as an important item, the event will not proceed.
* Changed the sprites of monsters added in 1.10.
* The code for Kumiromi of Harvest's signature move was weird and would cause crashes, so that was fixed.
* Fixed the draw radius for the animation of ball-type spells.


==1.10==
'''09/13/2012'''
 [Changes and additions]
* Added new evolutions.
* Added new special actions.
* Changed sprites of some existing monsters.
* AP will now be fully refunded when forgetting an AP special action or feat learned by the pet. AP spent on changing distance maintained from enemies and chance of movement are not refundable. Please be aware that if AP is more than 3000 when refunding, it goes to waste.
* Adjusted potential increase for potion of potential.
* Adjusted equipment stat increases with flying scrolls.
* Pets that split can be prevented from splitting by hitting them with a tamer's whip.
* Human NPCs and certain splitting monsters will have the flavour text that says "clone" and not "split" when splitting.
** NB: This does not affect the english version.
* Reduced maintenance cost of shop.
* Talking to Gavela after reaching a certain point in Act II while holding an <Awesome Swimwear> in your inventory causes something.
* Added and changed message displayed for martial arts and casting for each race. There shouldn't be any bugs with this.
* To prevent the Pic_1 bug when changing the portrait of a pet, entering "1" will cause it to return to the default portrait.
* PCC files will now be loaded from the "PCCs" folder for people who want to replace all the PCCs because of their size. If you want to use the PCC size that was used in vanilla Elona, please rename the "PCCs" folder to any name, then rename the "oldPCCs" folder into "PCCs".
** This is a feature from vanilla Elona, but please be aware that all of the PCCs and portraits files must be numbered consecutively.
** (e.g. It will not be possible to change your clothes from #15 to #13 if the file for clothes #14 does not exist.)
* The special actions unique to the eight gods have lower effect when used against another god race NPC.
* Card deck is no longer divided by domains and are now numbered.
* The evolved defender's signature special action has been changed from Provoke to the following:
** While it is active, all damage received by allies are negated, and the user receives half of that damage.
** Effects caused by the damage like paralysis are not negated.
** If HP goes into the negative because of this, the user will not die. However, it will no longer work when when HP is negative.
* The chance that skill experience received for all kinds of actions is doubled is increased by Learning.
* When the player Need Sleep! (red text), no skill experience is received by the player and his pets.
* Nerfed Wizard's Harvest spell. Put a cap on the gold gained, and changed the items received.
* Rods of wishing can be rarely received from treasure map treasure.
* The effect that appears when receiving AP after defeating an enemy that is of the right strength is blue.
* Level of necromancy monster is now displayed after their name.
* Lowered cost of special training at the doujou and capped the cost at 500k gp. However, the effect is now 2/3 of what it was.
* Reverted the experience received when eating a quickling corpse to what it used to be, but doubled it. Unlike other corpses, quickling corpses give pets more experience when they eat it compared to if the player had eaten it.
* When pets are not in combat, they will stay close to the player no matter what their distance maintained from enemy is.
* The amount that aging lunch and age return lunch will change age by is now different if they are blessed or cursed.
* Some NPCs are unusually large for their race (like lions in the cat race) or unusually small (like fairy in the servant race). The height and weight for these NPCs are not longer based on the race's values, and are calculated separately. If their size changes during evolution (e.g. little girl to littler girl), their height and weight will also change.
* Somewhat translated the journal and the conversations with Act II unique NPCs into English.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed how death or escaping bandit encounters are handled.
* Removed the possibility of the calculations for Obstinate feat causing a crash due to division by 0.
* Fixed PCCs returning to full size after restarting Elona+ after reduced was selected in the config.
* Fixed gold sheep having elemental resist bit flag instead of float bit by mistake.


==1.09==
 [Changes and additions]
* Lost kitty subquest will give a small amount of luck attribute experience or potential at random in addition to karma gain.
* Increased chance of pets gaining attribute potential when training in towns.
* Pets will have small increase in attribute potential when training in the doujou.
* Changed the potential gain from potion of potential. Potential gain used to decrease with potential, but the potential gain is now a fixed value.
* PCC (sprite for walking) is now a separate file so that it's easier to change and displays at actual size. Existing PCCs can be shrunk by selecting Reduced under Screen & Sound.
* Added new NPCs.
* Added new evolutions.
* Changed some sprites.
* coffin of necromancy can no longer be used on the world map. When returned to its coffin, a coffin of necromancy is generated at that location. The monster contained within the coffin is displayed in brackets.
* Added an option to display only damage on sandbagged monsters under Damage show.
* Evade is now lower when receiving damage from an enemy that is not the NPC currently targeted.
* The effect of Stealth that was multiplied by 10 times in the previous version appears to be too high, so it has been reduced to 3 times. The first attack on a hostile NPC that is not in combat has an increased critical rate. If the attack is a critical, Stealth experience is awarded. You may want to use this feature when roleplaying an assassin.
* Items marked as important can no longer be selected for use in item fusion.
* The servants that the small castle starts out with will appear only if you currently have no servants employed. If you have at least 1 servant, no servants will be provided and existing servants will be moved to the new location.
* Added Fire a volley special action. Pets who are able to do a ranged attack within 1 turn will all execute a ranged attack. These ranged attacks will not proc some types of elemental damage, nor invoke some equipment attributes, nor apply the effect of some special ammos.
* Buffed astral light pen. It can now be used on NPCs in towns like citizens on top of uniques. You can now recruit Moyer and bards who were previously unrecruitable. The NPC copy that you recruited will also have the same impress as the original.
* Looking at pets' character sheets at the informer was too expensive, so it is now 1,000 gp.
* Fixed the rarity in card information.
* Added magic and nether resistance gain to the corpses of some monsters. There weren't any monsters that seemed appropriate, so no corpses will give sound resistance.
* Added critical rate increase, and lowered chance to receive critical hits for Obstinate AP awakening feat.
* Made slight cosmetic changes to bandit encounter events.
* Portrait for pets can now be separately changed. For details, please look at the diagram in the graphic folder. (Not the user/graphic folder).
* The effect of chaos when imbued with Attribute special action will no longer wear off because it was too hard to use.
* Adjusted chance that special actions learned with AP or gained with evolution will be used.
* Changed the attributes that putitoro and puff puff bread affect.
* Some races will now kick when using Martial Arts. This is only a flavour text change, so kicks are no different from punches. Have fun with your tonfa kicks.
* Chain-casting spells was too weak, so the power was adjusted.
** NB: Exile's trait.
 [Fixes]
* Fixed the conditions for changing damage bonus, accuracy bonus, DV, and PV with flying scrolls.
* Fixed pets without Traveling skill gaining skill experience from traveling.
* Fixed stray cat and acid slime not being able to evolve because of an error in the code.
* Fixed bug where mana crystals were not used up in Necromancy recipe. Fixed coffins not changing their weight after returning them to their coffin.
* Fixed the spawn rate for a certain spring onion because it was too high. If you have too many of them, please eat some.
* Fixed ration (cargo) and marimo (cargo) not having location multipliers.


==1.08==
 [Changes and additions]
* Added new NPCs.
* Added new evolutions.
* Changed some sprites.
* Holy Veil, Holy Light, and Vanquish Hex can now be aimed at an adjacent tile. Holy Light and Vanquish Hex will no longer give Holy Veil.
* Chance of gathering materials is now always 10% or greater.
* When gene engineering, CNPCs will no longer impart body parts, skills, attributes, and levels to the NPC they are fused with. Other NPCs can still be fused to CNPCs.
* Effect of statue of Itzpalt changed from Meteor to Attribution Shield for the player and all pets within range of sight. Spell power is fixed.
* Fixed potions having a 10% chance of missing the tile they are aimed at no matter how high Throwing skill is. If you have enough Throwing, you will never miss. It also applies to enemies...
* It wasn't fair that the little girl was a warrior while the dog, cat, and bear were classless, so they are now predator. silver wolf and twintail are now priest.
* PV and DV of NPCs no longer increase with their level. Higher level NPCs will generate with higher Evasion and equipment skill levels, so they will still have greater evade and damage reduction.
* Cursed or doomed forbidden meat will change the user to bisexual or sexless. Eating another forbidden meat or wishing for "sex change" will remedy this. The way other characters will refer to this person and the sprite are too complicated to change, so all that will change is the sex displayed.
* AP will now be awarded for killing an enemy far stronger than you. But amount awarded is less than if you had killed an enemy somewhat stronger than you.
* An NPC's phobia of puff puff bread has worsened.
* Cost of enrolling a pet in the doujou has been reduced to 10,000 gp.
* Suicide fails when wet. Made a certain sub quest unaffected by weather.
* Targets of explosive ammos and BakuretuKen will now explode when they die to a normal attack.
* "attack bonus" description has been changed to "hit bonus" to make it clearer.
* Changing equipment weight with flying scrolls now affects equipment stats depending on its weight. Making it heavier will increase PV and damage bonus, but reduce DV and hit bonus. Making it lighter will decrease PV and damage bonus, but increase DV and hit bonus. Either way, there is a cap on the effects.
* Changed the calculation for strength of equipment attributes. There is a 20% chance that the equipment attribute will be increased. (It's 100% if you have Ehekatl's feat.)
* Added a special action that will change element of martial arts. The effect stacks, but it costs stamina.
* Monsters will now be summoned when casting spells while dimmed or confused only for the player.
* NPCs in town with cursed equipment will no longer teleport at random. The equipment attribute that gives random teleport still works.
* Damage display can be turned on and off under detailed settings. When on, only damage done to hostile enemies will be displayed.
* The effect of Stealth skill was insignificant, so it has been multiplied by 10.
* Unique NPCs will no longer breed on ranches.
* The special action for each of the 3 equipment types can now be targeted at an adjacent tile. It will not work if the target does not have the appropriate armour equipped, of course.
* Effect of Lulwy's Trick is now 20% of current speed + 150. It's spectacular when used in conjunction with Speed and Boost.
* Coffins that summon monsters can be crafted with item fusion. The type of undead depends on the value of the heart used, and its level depends on Alchemy and Anatomy. Upper limit is 1.5 times the deepest dungeon cleared. They can be returned to their coffin by interacting with them.
* Buffed starting skills for gunner and predator classes.

 [Fixes]
* Fixed the reduction in damage done during Atrophy. Damage done during Atrophy is now 25%.
* Fixed the bugged brainwash removal by Magic Kiss.
* The evolution for little girl added in the previous version would use magic. That was a bug, and it's fixed.
* Fixed pets enrolled in the doujou getting irritated or unleashed when a leash is used on them.
* Fixed your home moving back to its original location after a diastrophism if it is the starting cave. Because of the trigger, however, it will only take effect after your next moving.
* Fixed an artifact being carried by the wrong NPC.
* Made slight changes to Traveling.


==1.07==
 [Changes and additions]
* Fixed the delivery chest in Arcbelc added last version not working.
* Changed the calculation for gaining AP. Whether AP is gained or not now depends on the initial values of the main attributes except speed. If the enemy is too strong, then no AP is gained. Amount gained depends on initial speed. If your character is too strong and cannot gain any AP, try using the void, doing Panic quests, or killing guards and Gwen.
* Stayers can now be moved at the Maid house.
* Added new evolutions.
* Giving a small medal and a scroll of superior material to Garok will allow you to change the material of a material kit in your inventory. (To be precise it deletes an old material kit and generates a new one.) Inferior and superior materials have an equal chance of being selected. By the way, the material list for material kits and the actual list of materials are different in the code, so you may find material kits of the same material having different weight and colour. (This is a vanilla feature.)
* If the player has the Gentle Face feat, it will also work for pets' attacks.
* Up to 15 skills can now be tracked. Displaying the maximum number blocks your view by quite a bit, so use in moderation.
* Sleep sharing will no longer occur for pets outside your range of sight.
* Slightly nerfed metal bit flag's resistance. It was previously 10% of a random number from 0 to original damage. It is now fixed at 10% of original damage + 1.
* Fixed some NPC sprites.
* <Cleaning Doll> now shows up in the list of little sister rewards.
* Fixed additional attacks with explosive ammos not targeting the right thing.
* You now have to select which direction to use BakuretuKen in. It has been reverted to Martial Arts + grenade.
* If you select to give battle directives while riding, you can now toggle your steed between defence and attack modes. command flag still works the same, so use whichever better suits your needs.
* Call Familiar no longer uses a turn. Reduced SP cost. Fixed the bug that occurred when calling out a pet that was busy (e.g. eating) when you put it away.
* Tentatively made damage value visible even when not using a sand bag. Might revert this change because it makes sand bags rather useless.
* Cold damage and Death Word will be indiscriminately applied to the whole map (like meteor) when an eternal force weapon is used. Damage depends on Magic Device skill and Magic attribute. Eternal force weapons may only be used once. The weapons will no longer be eternal force after usage. There is still no activation animation.
* The data for removed deeds and cleared Nefias remains on the world map, so random diastrophisms now have the same effect as the diastrophisms that occur when moving between North and South Tyris. Items on the world map (including placed shelters) and Nefias that have been entered but have yet to be cleared will also be removed, so be careful. Diastrophisms from Statue of Opatos are unaffected by the changes.
* Changed a bit of code for how the items in shops are handled, so there may or may not be issues. Please back up your save file before using this version. As always, of course, but I'm saying this just in case.


==1.06==
 [Changes and additions]
* When unzipping the file, the folder name will now have the version number.
* Made a slight change to readme file name. Added a bit of information on transferring save files.
* Changed the harvesting spots from which some materials can be harvested.
* Changed the character sprites that were being stretched to the fixed versions. If the sprites are off or if there are artifacts let me know.
* Placed guild reporters for all guilds in South Tyris, so it is now possible to receive and fulfill guild quotas there. They are in Melkawn, Valm, and Arcbelc. The delivery chest for mages guild should appear when the town refreshes...
* Added coconut crab. Like the bomb fish and sandborer, it is unobtainable from fishing. It is worth more than any other fish when sacrificed to Ehekatl.
* NB: Original changelog says sandporer.
* Buffed speed upper. It will now also increase Speed by 1. It still recovers Speed potential, so it does not decrease the potential like hermes blood.
* Slightly increased the chance of using special actions learned with AP.
* token of friendship is now craftable via item fusion.
* When talking to a pet who is a unique NPC, the "Let's Talk." option and impress level will now be displayed.
* Reduced fighters guild quota by half.
* Blankets with 0 charges left are now guaranteed to be destroyed when receiving damage of the appropriate element. (The chance of them getting destroyed was only 5% prior to this change.)
* If Gwen (the Act II+ version) already exists, she will be removed and replaced when entering Yowyn. Gwen will now grow stronger depending on the number of times she dies. If you have the Gwen from previous versions as a pet, please put her somewhere safe just in case she also disappears during the reset. If you have time to kill, please back up your save file and test to see if Gwen pets will also disappear.
* NPCs that spawn naturally in towns are now more likely to spawn.
* BakuretuKen wasn't working well with things like additional attacks, so it has been changed from "melee + Martial Arts dependent grenade damage" to "slightly more powerful Martial Arts dependent grenade damage". Slightly increased SP cost. Usable even when a weapon is equipped.
* Added an AP feat. AP feats are now displayed in green on the feats tab.
* Added a magic reflect equipment attribute. Shield and back equipment only. It should not work on spells used between friendly characters.
* Tweaked Big Daddy spawning level.
* Fixed some items selling for more when unidentified.
* Made some changes to items sold at the stalls during the Noyel holy festival and Ludus' rain festival.


==1.05==
 [Changes and additions]
* I forgot to change the race of meshera NPCs last version, causing them to be raceless, so that has been fixed.
* Fixed the error and crash that occurred when moving into a map with a certain NPC on it.
* Made changes to NPCs located in the Deep-sea castle.
* Relaxed the material requirements for crafting. As such, the following craftable items have their material requirements changed:
** disc
** wing
** charm
** talisman
** armored cloak
** pope robe
** scroll of minor teleportation
** rope (cargo)
** scroll of teleportation
** piano (cargo)
** barrel (cargo)
** rag doll (cargo)
** potion of healer <Eris>
** potion of healer <Odina>
** vindale cloak
** shoes
** robe
** light mail
* Made more items craftable from materials.
* Fixed some materials being unobtainable from harvesting.
* Made salary chest, freezer, and heir trunk usable in the South Tyris Maid house. Door type can also be changed with a house board. Using a staircase will affect the sub quest, so staircases have been disabled.
* Made some powerful feats purchasable with AP. More to come in the future.
* Prevented the fences on the ranch from blocking line of sight.
* Nerfed murder cockroach but made them split.
* Fixed class-changed item not working correctly when used on pets.
* Reduced skill potential increase during sleeping because it was a little too much.
* When the player is brainwashed, he has a chance of taking off equipment depending on Charisma. Be careful that you don't let your guard down and find yourself stark naked all of a sudden.


==1.04==
 [Changes and additions]
* There will now be an animation that plays when AP is earned. Pets now earn more AP than the player.
* There may be more uses for AP in the future, so the cost of awakening has been reduced by about half (except for speed increase).
* Changed prerequisite for learning Charge Attack from 150 Constitution to 120 Constitution.
* Fixed BGM not playing in North Tyris town underground maps.
* Added a few NPCs.
* Fishing with machine lure will now give experience, albeit very rarely.
* Changed door type in the ninja house and Melugas. Changed sprite for Melugas. It should change after the town is refreshed.
* Added ball-type lightning spell. Lightning element is strong, so there is no spellbook for it.
* When pets use Summon Monster spell or special action, it will now do nothing.
* Added evolution patterns. There will eventually be at least 1 evolution for every race except god, metal, yith, and some other races.
* Neutral spirit NPCs can now be made to leave by interacting with them.
* There seems to be more players using DV now, so Punishment will now lower DV as well. Changed formula for the speed penalty.
* Meshera race has been renamed as bacteria because the name was too specific and if the player picks it it clashes horribly with the story. Existing characters of this race will now display as "0" race, but they should still work the same.
* Added an item to make unique NPCs into pets. 3 of the NPCs added in this update will drop it rarely, and it can also be wished for. However, there are a lot of restrictions and it's expensive to use. If it has any effect on quests, please let me know. If you recruit a god and leave them on the ranch, they will neither breed nor spawn servants. Too bad!
* The number of seeds that the cute fairy spits out is now 1-3.
* Prevented wishes in the log from getting sent to chat.
* Breeders and shopkeepers will no longer get experience from traveling.
* Change how staircase furniture works. If you place one at the edge of the map and try to use it, pressing enter will move you to another floor. Pressing the arrow keys and selecting the one pointing outside then pressing enter will take you outside, no matter which floor you are on. Use this if you find it troublesome to walk up all the way from the bottom floor of your house.
* The levels of random dungeons is now slightly less extreme.
* Changed and consolidated some material harvesting spots. The wait time for harvesting materials has been tentatively disabled.
* Food that doesn't rot will no longer have an expiry time set.
* When Cheer is used on the player, the effect of Contingency is decreased to 33% and 3 turns.
* Fixed the bug where bird race NPCs had random parts added to them.
* Changed Elemental Shield to Attribution Shield, and it now buffs fire, cold, lightning, nerve, mind, poison, sound, chaos, and darkness resistances. Effect depends on spell level and has no cap. Shortened the buff duration.


==1.03==
 [Changes and additions]
* The health bar that is visible after auscultating pets is yellow if they are not hungry.
* Revamped how BGM plays on every map.
* Added quite a few new high-level monsters.
* Added evolutions (albeit simple ones) for spirit-type monsters.
* Fixed the bug where it was not possible to walk out of the house when standing on staircase furniture.
* Increased damage done by Mani's gem stone of satellite shooter, and changed it from non-elemental to lightning element.
* Changed the platinum-laying ability of the goose from random to a guaranteed event that doesn't reoccur until you sleep. (Works like Lay Hand). The counter is off by default, so you'll have to sleep once for it to make it happen the first time.
* Prevented pets enrolled in the doujou and ranch monsters from gaining levels. The disabling of gene engineering on the doujou in the previous version has been reverted.
* The error and crash that occurs while performing should be fixed for real this time.
* Fixed beetle and kabuto being unable to evolve.
* Clear Mind buff now affects Will, Perception, Evasion, Greater Evasion, and Martial Arts, and slight changes to the calculation has been made.
* Prevented monsters that are level 50 or higher from appearing during ragnarok.
* Fixed some precious equipment not glowing.
* Probably fixed maidsann having a chance to spawn outside the Maid house.
* Made salt solution, lightsabre, potion of cure mutation, rod of change creature, and music discs craftable from materials.
* Item fusion: fixed magic ice being craftable from Pebbles for some reason. Added item requirements for all item fusions.


==1.02==
 [Changes and additions]
* When an existing pet is selected with Call Familiar, it will now wait in town.
* NPCs (including non-pets) who are at Friend or above can be handed token of friendship to increase their impress. Love potions will no longer increase impress after Friend is reached.
* Added Dimensional Move, Healing Rain, Shadow Step, BakuretuKen, and Charge Attack as skills purchasable with AP for pets. Combat style (like distance maintained) can also be changed.
* Door type on your deeds can be changed with the house board. The changes will be reflected when you reenter the map.
* Added Gravity Ball special action and the enchantment that invokes it. The power depends on the user's and the target's attributes, the floor it is used on, and magic resistance. It won't do much damage on shallow floors, but it will do more on deeper dungeon floors. Damage is reduced by Feather buff.
* Changed and added new items. Inner Mani's precious weapon has been changed to the Gravity Gun to complement the above change.
* Added new NPCs.
* Fixed being able to summon pets with Call Familiar in the arena.
* Made slight modifications to the snowy terrain around Noyel to prevent pure white treasure map.
* Disabled Gene Engineering at the Doujou. (This is the easiest solution to the problem.)
* Made some materials harder to find on shallower dungeon floors. May have made it a little too hard.
* Adjusted spawn rate of material gathering spots like the spring and mining spot.
* Fixed the bug that occurred when NPCs have a little tail while using certain items.
* The error and crash that occurs while performing should be fixed for good.
* Fixed the bug where another heart generated in pairs.
* Made the flavour text displayed when eating food while eating food off the ground is forbidden customizable. Please use the talk file as an example.


==1.01==
 [Changes and additions]
* Rebalanced damage done by elemental and non-elemental spells.
* Updated CNPC creation manual.
* Rebalanced speed increases with AP. Made current AP cap at 3000. Tentatively added Insult and Crystal Spear as purchasable special actions for pets.
* Added sleep event. May occur for pets who are Fellow and above. The event increases impress of that pet as well as...
* If you're looking to change the background for the event, the file is bg_re16.bmp.
* Made it possible to change the flavor text for the above events, when Insulted, when kissed (at high impress), when giving chocolate, when switching tamer's whip on/off. Use the talk sample as an example. Feel free to contribute default lines.
* Rebalanced experience. Ideally, it should make you the same level as enemies that you are able to defeat. Made pet training cost depend only on their attributes. (The cap is 20,000, and can be reduced to 10,000 with Charisma.) Made quest difficulty depend on deepest dungeon cleared.
* Rebalanced the amount of experience and materials gained when searching material spots. Experience is gained even when the search fails, so it's a good idea to search every spot if you have the required skill.
* Changed the sprites of some monsters.
* Made pets no longer eat off the floor in ranches and in shops. Food will also not rot in shops when you have a shopkeeper.
* Fixed the bug where Big Daddies didn't drop little sisters when defeated with spells. Little sisters should not spawn when they are attacked by a monster's regular attack, but they may spawn if the Big Daddy dies to something other than a regular attack.
* Fixed the bug where accuracy increased when heavy armor is equipped while riding.
* Fixed the bug where pressing F3 gave an error. To be precise, made the card game demo not start.
* Fixed the error that happens during performing. Chance of having a reward thrown at you is halved, and rewards no longer include junk items.


==1.00==
 [Changes and additions]
* Riding skill was a Speed skill in 0.99 and versions prior to that, but it has been reverted to a Will skill.
* Added content up to Act II ending. It is also no longer possible to go to South Tyris before clearing Act I.
* Rebalanced and renamed a lot of things. Many NPCs and items are different from how they were in versions 0.99 and earlier.
* Added new NPCs.
* Added new items. Added a new deed that will allow you to move your house as it is.
* Rebalanced trading again.
* Added new special actions.
* Added new evolutions.
* Changed some item fusion recipes.
* Added portraits.
* Added some temporary features to the AP system. Only speed can be increased for now. Available in Ruoza from Act II onwards. Don't spend too much AP now, because the exchange rate may change and there may be feats that can be exchanged.
* The level of randomly generated dungeons depends on the lowest dungeon floor cleared (not the lowest floor entered) and how far into the main quest you are. That means that the further in the main quest you go and the higher the difficulty of dungeons you clear, the higher the difficulty of the dungeons that are generated.
* Cap for CNPC level is now 350. However, their actual level will only go up to 2 x deepest dungeon floor cleared. CNPCs will also be generated on the left of the player when possible.
* After consulting with Noa, the Intention attribute was supposed to be Will (in English it displays as "Will"). Fixed it as such. If it says "Intention" somewhere, please tell me.
* Made Big Daddies not drop little sisters if they are not defeated by the player or the player's allies.
* Made god-race NPCs weaken when they are recruited by the player.
* Buffed Elemental Scar and Nightmare by a lot.
* After finishing the maid mansion sub quest, you can now enter the basement by talking to <Lune>.
* Containers like chests will no longer regenerate with alchemy.
* Slightly increased the damage and PV bonus from using cursed flying scrolls.
* Rebalanced vomiting damage during anorexia based on the amount of damage you can continuously do and the ease of carrying and making cursed alcohol. (Calculation is different for player, for pets, and for other NPCs.) Unique NPCs will have a 0.1% of recovering from anorexia when regeneration occurs.
* Searching for materials is no longer auto turn to prevent bugs.
* Made pets level Weight Lifting (when player is Burden or above), Stealth, Light, Medium, and Heavy Armor skills with the passage of turns.
* Re-balanced a lot of things.
* Fixed errors in the settings.
* The domains in the card decks are kind of off, but the way they will be divided will be changed in the future so it will remain that way for now.


==0.99==
 [Changes and additions]
* Descriptions for all cards is done. Thanks for the help everyone!
* Added items.
* Ending is now done. (But last boss is still undefeatable.)
* Added evolution patterns.
* Added quick save and load with F1 and F2.
* Changed and added item fusion recipes.
* Made traps disappear after being triggered once.
* Re-balanced a lot of things.
* Fixed errors in the settings.


==0.98 Valenteine Edition==
 [Changes and additions]
* NB: (sic)
* Interacting with NPCs (including uniques) and asking for chocolate in February will make them give you chocolate. However, you can only ask for chocolate from one person every year. (Chocolate from the wish goddess doesn't count.) The counter is reset at the beginning of February, so if it's already February you will have to wait for a whole year. Chocolates from NPCs with low cooking skill may explode.
* Evolution system has been revamped. Some of the old evolution items have been removed. The old evolution items now appear as remnant items, but they will be replaced when you enter Cyber Dome.
* Changed and added evolutions. Main ones are the older sister, younger sister, dog, cat, bear, fire dragon.
* Existing NPCs and characters without Firearm skill will learn it upon entering Cyber Dome.
* Changed worship bonuses for Kumiromi and Yacatect.
* Exp will no longer be awarded for planting seeds to prevent exp grinding by spamming seeds. Harvesting crops will now give more exp to make up for that.
* Re-balanced a lot of things.
* Fixed errors in the settings.


==0.98==
 [Changes and additions]
* Added a lot of resources from the official forums.
* Added a new NPC to the Cyber Dome who will help explain things to beginners.
* Fixed and added card descriptions.
* Interact with gods and choosing 'Remand' and wishing for 'repatriation' of inner gods respectively will make them leave. Both of these events have flavour text.
* All races and classes will now start off with Firearm skill.
* The name 'BP' was leading to a lot of mix-ups with skill bonus points, so it has been renamed as 'AP'.
* Added portraits.
* Re-balanced a lot of things.
* Fixed errors in the settings.


==0.97==
 [Changes and additions]
* Added new BP stat. This is displayed underneath karma. This can be earned only by pets when they kill enemies stronger than them. No points will be awarded for killing weak enemies and enemies that split.
* Added new NPCs.
* Fixed and added card descriptions.
* The Palmian embassy will now sell deed of dungeons.
* Changed the recipe holder to card packs. When opened, they will give 5 cards. Unlike cards dropped by NPCs upon their death, however, these cards will not raise museum rank when placed in the museum.
* Training cost for pets will decrease by up to half depending on their Charisma.
* Updated in-game help (Shift+?) because it was rather outdated.
* Drop rates of <Gould's Piano> and other items from the highest-tier new year's gift were too low, so they have been increased.
* Potions of descent no longer drop from zombies. They are now randomly generated.
* Re-balanced a lot of things.
* Fixed errors in the settings.


==0.96==
 [Changes and additions]
* Currently rebalancing item fusion. These are not the last of the changes. You will have to find the recipes somewhere or buy them at a souvenir shop. There may be compatibility issues with the old recipes. Please test this and tell me whether you think this is balanced or not.
* Made some enemies brainwash friendly NPCs (including pets) to make them attack the player. Brainwash goes away with time or with a special action. The status effect also goes away on death. NPCs with higher impress will have higher resist against brainwashing. When the player is brainwashed, he will only be confused.
* Fixed and added card descriptions.
* Re-balanced a lot of things.
* Fixed errors in the settings.


==0.95==
 [Changes and additions]
* Added something like a sub quest to the maid manor. Set new spawning conditions for gokiburi.
* Fixed the reported doujou issues.
* Made crops wither far less on the farm. However, there is a mechanic in place from vanilla Elona that gives crops a chance to wither regardless of your Gardening skill, so this change will only make things slightly easier for low-level gardeners.
* Significantly reduced damage done by attack magic.
* Made it possible to trade music tickets for cards at Larna. How about aiming to get every card?
* Re-balanced a lot of things.
* Fixed errors in the settings.


==0.94==
 [Changes and additions]
* Balanced dungeon and performing rewards.
* Tax was way too low after the changes in previous version, so it is now 3% of your money. It may increase to 5% in future versions.
* Seeds are now rewarded for The Harvest Time quests. Seeds can no longer be offered to Kumiromi.
* Added pet doujou. If you leave a pet there for a while and then pick it up later, it will gain skill experience depending on distance you traveled on the world map. While your pet is there, it will gain no levels no matter what. If a pet dies at the doujou, it will be resurrected and you can pick it up at the town as usual. If you want to take a pet out, (i)nteract with it and choose to take it out. There are probably issues with this new system, so please backup your save file and try it out with an expendable pet.
* Added a unique NPC who will trade you items for music tickets.
* Made a lot of items craftable with Tailoring.
* Fixed and added card descriptions.
* Re-balanced a lot of things.
* Fixed errors in the settings.

 [Unfinished features and known issues]
* Re-balance everything.
* Can't seem to get the card domains right.


==0.93==
 [Changes and additions]
* Expanded main quest and added cutscenes.
* Probability of getting a wish from quaffing wells and other water sources increases with karma.
* Tax now depends entirely on amount of money you have. It is now independent of fame and level. If amount of money is decreased too drastically to reduce the tax paid, then it will instead depend on number of turns passed.
* Halved level threshold for stoning during performances. Audience will only throw items as rewards, however. Also made ensemble increase quality of items thrown by audience and performance score.
* Amount of money that dungeons give now depends on the floor number. Probability of generating small medals will now depend on fame.
* There is a low chance that skill experience earned for doing actions will be doubled. Probability that the experience is doubled increases with Learning attribute. This change was made because the Learning stat wasn't very useful (especially for NPCs).
* People staying in your home will also move with you when you acquire a new house.
* Changed bonus for hunter class to an increase in hit rate for all physical attacks.
* Fixed and added card descriptions.
* Re-balanced a lot of things.
* Fixed errors in the settings.

==0.92==
 [Changes and additions]
* Showrooms created in Elona+ will have the .pum extension, and pets will have the .pet extension. They will no longer show up in the list for other versions. Elona+ showrooms will also show up last in the list. .pet will not display unless it is in the user folder.
* Prevented additional ranged attacks from procing with special ammo. Please think of additional ranged attacks as finishing blows to the enemy.
* Fixed second weapon attack and onwards having the same element as the previous weapon attack.
* Fixed goose platinum laying having a higher priority than the food's effects when eating food.
* Fixed and added card descriptions.
* Re-balanced a lot of things.
* Fixed errors in the settings.

 [Unfinished features and known issues]
* Re-balance everything.

==0.91==
 [Changes and additions]
* Fixed adjusting the window size casing the display to go weird during the Act I ending.
* Added a sub quest. (Naplus')
* Added an item that can change your class and race.
* Fixed crash that resulted from turning in a quest when fame is low.
* Pets were way too aggressive in attack mode, so their aggressiveness was greatly reduced.
* Made trading slightly easier.
* Adjusted drop rate for materials. Now you won't keep getting Garbage deep in the dungeons, but it also means you probably won't be finding 500 yen coins on easier floors.
* Made material boxes and scroll of gain material have a chance of generating all kinds of material independent of the floor you're on and the type of gathering spot.
* When uploading a showroom, it will automatically append "?{??" to the room name and the welcome message. To avoid issues, please delete showrooms created before 0.91 from here:
** http://hpcgi3.nifty.com/rfish/usercgi/clip.cgi
** NB: There may be no equivalent indicator for English showrooms?
* Increased value of casino rewards. Casinos will now give scrolls of faith and potions of potential depending on the number of consecutive wins and the number of chips bet. Made it easier to win potions of cure corruption.
* Re-balanced a lot of things.
* Fixed errors in the settings.

 [Unfinished features and known issues]
* Re-balance everything.
* Can't seem to get the card domains right.


==0.90==
 [Changes and additions]
* Made allies not push others around.
* Made allies search for enemies and take the initiative to attack them. If the player has an enemy targeted, it will be made the priority. Enabled toggling to Defense mode where they will neither move nor attack. Using the command mode will change the mode of all allies in your field of vision; the special action will change it for individual allies. Damage received during Defense mode is 1/3.
* Made significant changes to the main quest to match Noa's original plans. It's actually done all the way up to the ending, but it's not accessible yet.
* Changed feat intrinsic to the pianist class. Made it sound resistance.
* But just damage reduction alone is kind of crappy, so sound damage will be nullified sometimes.
* Changed Ludus summer festival to the rain festival. That said, all that was done was to add character talk and new NPCs.
* Increased cost of Rampage, made it also affect allies in view.
* Made Slow spell debuff capped at 50% of the enemy's speed.
* Changed <Anubis> from doggod to dog. His attributes have been greatly decreased as a result of that, but watch out for his special attacks.
* Made servants use the new special actions after they are evolved. (Assuming it works correctly.)
* Gave armor-type monsters a new bit flag. It reduces damage received, though not as much as the metal bit flag. Changed metal bit flag of android to this.
* Changed made moon gate destination selectable like runes instead of being random. This is to prevent problems like users from not knowing which room it was they visited, or getting the room's welcome message truncated.
* Money rewarded for completing town board quests now decreases as fame increases, but platinum pieces received will increase instead. Set an upper limit for the number of platinum pieces required for skill training.
* Added new NPCs and new items, though some of them will not show up at any point in the game.
* Added Forest of Doggod to south-west South Tyris. There is a doggod (extremely strong) on the bottom floor, but nothing will happen if you defeat him for now. Be careful about what you drop, because every floor is randomized when you enter it like the Puppy Cave.
* Revamped races. Leeches and centipedes are now part of the new worm race. Scorpions are now part of spider race. chupacabura is now a bear, and <Isca> is now an angel. carmilla and vampire are now part of the new mazin race. The old centipede and vampire races are now defunct.
* Changed the starting attributes for angel, imp, and gods.
* Fixed bug where class would revert to the original after changing it with a wish. In addition to that, you can now make a superficial change to your race.
* Re-balanced a lot of things.
* Fixed errors in the settings.

 [Unfinished features and known issues]

* Re-balanced a lot of things.
* Fixed errors in the settings.

* Can't seem to get the card domains right.


==0.81==
 [Changes and additions]
* Added some new NPCs.
* Made slight changes to the South Tyris map. If you have your house in the northern part of South Tyris, you need to be careful when upgrading to this version.
* Increased weapon damage for both allies and enemies. Increased effect of Holy Shield and added a spell that buffs DV.
* Maybe this will make characters that specialize in dodging viable without the desire for violence disease?
* Made tamer's whip more useful. You can now not only prevent eating off the ground, but also quaffing water sources and picking up ores.
* No new content added to Act II main quest since 0.80.
* Buffed magic. If it's too strong, please tell me.
* Implemented pet evolution system. It's still being balanced, but some NPCs can now be evolved. Most of the evolutions are those of servants for now.
* Treasure maps can only be read in an area where there is treasure. (This is a measure to prevent errors.)
* <Anubis> was too strong, so he got weakened a little.
* When little sisters die after being recruited as allies, the number killed death counter will not increase.
* Re-balanced a lot of things.
* Fixed errors in the settings.

==0.80==
 [Changes and additions]
* Added some new items and new NPCs.
* There was an issue with the strength of enemies in the wilderness. The enemy strength calculation done when you enter the wilderness of your own volition has been reverted back to how it was in vanilla Elona to fix that. The enemy strength formula for attacks remains as it is.
* Added content for Act II main quest, all the way down to the bottom floor of Rehmido. You will not be able to win against the boss at this stage.
* Added an item that changes your sex! It is obtainable part way through Act II. It was already implemented in game though, and was obtainable by wishing for it.
* Made some NPCs drop items used for evolutions. This is to prepare for the implementation of the evolution system. The evolutions themselves aren't available yet.
* Made the fighter's guild more attractive. Buffed the perks and made their quests easier.
* When changing class with a wish, if the new class is a class that actually exists, it will cause an actual non-superficial class change.
* Re-balanced a lot of things.
* Fixed errors in the settings.

==0.75==
 [Changes and additions]
* Added some new items and new NPCs.
* Strength of enemies encountered when you enter the wilderness by your own volition was bugged. I've fixed it... probably.
* Made it possible to change class by wishing. This is only a superficial change, however.
* Made classes give significant bonuses. This affects existing characters and NPCs.
* Made breath attacks affected by Control Magic. Gave dog and dragon races innate Control Magic skill. Now you can have breath-using pets without getting burned!
* Existing NPCs who have their portraits changed will now reflect the changes when you exit and reenter the map.
* Added sprites for every failed cooked food.
* Ludus, the farming village in South Tyris, will now have a Summer festival. The map will change during map refresh in the 8th month every year to the festival map. It's kind of lame compared to the holy festival in Noyel, but you shouldn't expect too much of a poor farming village.
* Re-balanced a lot of things.
* Fixed errors in the settings.

 [Unfinished features and known issues]
* Re-balance everything.
* Can't seem to get the card domains right.
* The BGM doesn't change when you go up and down stairs on some maps. (This is getting ridiculous.)


==0.74==
 [Changes and additions]
* Haven't added any Act II content.
* Made crafting easier. Maybe a little too easy. Especially Carpentry.
* Made enemy attacks depend on the player's level instead of the distance from towns.
* Added an item. When used, it allows you to target enemies without attacking them or manually targeting them with 'l'ook. If a shortcut key is assigned to it, you can easily make your pets fight for you. Shops will sell this.
* Slightly reduced power of Martial Arts. Added martial arts special actions that have added elemental damage to make up for it.
* Made puff puff bread uncraftable without flour.
* putitoro was too powerful so its effect was nerfed. It will make you enter a period of Charisma growth instead.
* Gave some unique NPCs portraits. NPCs who have already been generated will probably be unaffected by the changes.
* Sprites for cooking and herbs are now separate. There aren't any sprites for failed cooking, so if you have any please send them to me.
* Some materials now have additional properties. Mithril is also slightly lighter, and dragon scale is slightly stronger.
* Re-balanced a lot of things.
* Fixed errors in the settings.

==0.73==
 [Changes and additions]
* Added a little bit of content to Act II.
* Wanted to make it impossible to get to South Tyris until Act I is cleared... but I guess that's not happening. However, I intend to make it work that way when the final version is released.
* Fixed new enemies doing less damage than they should with weapons due to the change in damage formula.
* Prevented elemental attacks from doing no damage at high resistance. Elemental attacks can't be nullified, but they will do less damage the more resistance you have. "I'm so happy for you, Elemental Shield!" "We're going to more important from now on!"
* NB: Last two lines is a reference to a comic by Kawadi MAX...
* Made escort and delivery quests not direct you to the town you're in.
* Increased number of unique NPCs appearing in Party Time! quests from Act II onwards.
* Made Yacatect also accept neck equipment.
* Fixed some bugged sub quest triggers.
* Re-balanced a lot of things.
* Fixed errors in the settings.

==0.72==
 [Changes and additions]
* Added a little bit of content to Act II.
* Wanted to make it impossible to get to South Tyris until Act I is cleared... but I guess that's not happening.
* Made the guild masters of each guild give a special quest. The reward isn't that good because it's a quest available in Act I.
* Made speed upper recover a lot of Speed potential, made herbs give Speed experience, and made Riding, Swimming, and Traveling give speed experience.
* Made <Gwen> grow up after clearing Act I. (Just like the character that she's based on.)
* NB: Gwen from Guild Wars.
* You can still get the secret treasure of saint when defeating her, but she is a lot stronger. By the way, <Noel> will rarely drop the secret treasure of wicked when killed.
* Re-balanced a lot of things.
* Fixed errors in the settings.

 [Unfinished features and known issues]
* Re-balance everything.

==0.71==
 [Changes and additions]
* Player and pets will earn experience in all skills depending on Traveling skill and distance traveled.
* The amount of experience gained is not final and is still being balanced. It should be just enough that you'll see a significant improvement in skills that are hard to train after walking around the entire continent.
* Made music tickets exchangeable at a certain NPC in Arcbelc. The exchange rate is still being balanced, so let me know if it's too high/low/just right.
* Fixed portraits having transparency in them.
* Added just the opening of Act II.
* Made it impossible to get to South Tyris before clearing Act I. One thing to keep in mind: if Act I has not been cleared but you have already visited a South Tyris town, you will get delivery and escort quests to South Tyris. 
* (It should be possible to make it so that quests for South Tyris don't generate until you stop by a South Tyris town...)
* Fixed Swimming skill gaining no experience and having no effect for pets.
* Changed a lot of card descriptions.
* Added a lot of resources I forgot to include. There might still be some I forgot.

* Re-balanced a lot of things.
* Fixed errors in the settings.
