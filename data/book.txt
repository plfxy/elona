给迷路士兵的指南书
	written by 艾沃达纳的将军
（注）非艾沃达纳士兵不得阅读！

　迷路的诸位士兵们，茫然于该如何行动的
诸位士兵们、你们不需要任何担心。和队伍
走散的时候该如何行动，就由我来作个简单
的说明吧。

■该如何行动

　首先从战场上逃离，向着东南的煤矿城镇
韦尔尼斯前进即可。镇里有食物供给，如果
攒了一笔小钱的话也可以购买其他的物资。

　做了适当的准备之后、即可朝着镇东附近
的洞窟出发。那里对于想积累经验的新兵来
说是最合适的地方，也能稍微赚到一些钱。

■不该采取的行动

　不要轻率地到处乱闯。新手不小心闯进陌
生的迷宫后，立刻被恐怖的危险生物杀掉的
事情时有发生。

　要一直留意食物的储备量。
食物很贵，但对于生存是必须的。虽然除了
买取以外还有不少获得食物的方式，但随时
注意肚子的饥饿程度仍是必须的。

■最终的目的是？

　积累了足够的经验的话、就以莱希墨苏洞
穴为目标吧。那是奈菲亚的遗迹群之一，据
说其中隐藏着能将我等艾沃达纳人引向繁荣
的重大秘密。

　至今为止仍没有人能到达洞穴最下层并
活着归来。谁能解开这个迷宫的秘密，就
会获得巨额的赏金。

最后祝诸君马到成功！

Beginner's Guide
	Author: An Old Adventurer

<This book is weathered and yellow
with age>
	
I leave this book here in the off
chance that should I not survive my
final adventure, others may learn
from my trials and tribulations.

I have lived many years and have
done many deeds. I have seen much
what this world has to offer.

This cave has been my hideaway in the
last few seasons, though if you are
reading this, it is most likely now
yours to reside in. I don't mind as
I'm either dead or fabulously rich.

Still, if you are planning on going
into the same trade as I and are not
the local scamps just playing at it,
some advice should be parted to you.

Now where to begin?

I won't know from which way you came
from so it's best to give you the 
local landmarks;

If you follow the trail from here to
the South-East you find Vernis. It's
a mining town, but it should still
have some shops, a tavern and an inn.
You should be able to find some work
there, as well as food, gear, and 
even a friend or two. The innslady I
recall was having some trouble with
local ruffians the last time I was
there. 

East of Vernis is what the locals 
call the "Puppy Cave". It's well...
always changing. A local mage called
it a "Hausdorff-Besicovitch fractal
plane", whatever that means. 
If you leave the cave and come back, 
or go up or down floors, it will
change all the creatures, items, 
walls, and exits. You can find quite 
a bit of stuff if you don't mind 
hopping in and out. 

The "Puppy" of this cave is fairly
deep in, and a child in town would
love to get it back, but it kept
getting itself killed when I tried.
It always reappeared on that floor 
when I left and came back, but I 
gave up after a few tries. Maybe
you can do it. Just don't get lost.

Once you are a bit tougher and better
geared, the Gray cave of Lesimas
might be be another good spot. It's
one of the more ancient ruins of
Nefia, and there's bound to be
something interesting in there. If
you ignore the roads, it's almost due
south of this cave.

No doubt all around the land there
will be caves and forests spawning
with loathsome critters. Just don't
go blindly into them, check them out
BEFORE going in. Preparation is a key
difference from a live Adventurer and
a dead one. 
         -== Geography ==-
If you follow the roads from Vernis:
-Port Kapul is to the west. 3-5 days
  Good Business there as it's a port
  Fighters Guild and an Arena
  
-Palmia is to the East. 2-3 days
  Big City, lots to see and do
  King lives here
  Has Arena
  
-Yowyn is to the South-East. 2-3 days
  Farm Town, not a lot to do unless
  you like turnips and Harvesting.
  Note to self: Clean out Yeek's Nest
  AGAIN... worse than rabbits they be
  
-Lumiest is South-East of Palmia
  On an Island
  Lots of mages live there
  
-Derphy is South-west of Vernis
  No roads lead there
  Wretched hive of scum and villainy
  Steer clear of Dragon's Nest!

-Noyel is Far FAR to the east
  Bring a sandwich, it's a long walk
  Snow is slow going
  Don't poke the Fire Giant. Bad juju
  
      -== Work and Jobs ==-
While you may want to go about
slaying dragons and saving damsels,
it's best to start small. Being an
adventurer means you'll do jobs that
no one else wants to do.

Deliveries are a good way to start
out in this business. Example:
     Accept job
  -->GET THE ITEM AT YOUR FEET!<--
     Deliver item to recipient
     Collect reward
Note that forgetting the item to 
deliver is very BAD, but not the end 
of the world. If you are very lucky,
the local shops or fields may have
what you are looking for. They won't
know the difference, trust me. 
Also note how many days you have to
deliver things. Running from Lumiest
to Port Kapul is NOT fun, and you may
simply not be fast enough yet to do
the really high paying ones. 

Hunting can range from easy to very
VERY hard. The money offered is a 
good way to tell how bad it will be.
Be careful doing these, as it takes
just one nasty critter to get you.

Gift getting also ranges from easy
to absurd. Just remember that if you
accept the job, running from town to
home and back takes time, and you may
not have that long to do it.

Cooking requests are only good if you
can cook, have the items, and can
deliver before the food rots. But if
you check out the local bakery before
accepting, you may just be able to
buy what you need before doing the
job.

Harvesting LOOKS easy, but it can be 
very hard. Waste no time, and go as
unburdened as possible. Speed is the
key for these jobs.
Finally, try not to fail a job, it's
a black stain on your record, and too
many of those can get the guards on
you. Use you noggin BEFORE accepting
any job. Can I do it? Will I have the
time? Who gets their kid garbage on
their birthday?

      -== Advice and Tips ==-
And now a few nuggets of wisdom:

-Cargos of food are cheap, and you'll
eat them as you travel overland. But
you cannot eat them inside towns or
dungeons. If you are hungry just exit
the town or dungeon, eat, and enter.

-Be cheap. 'b'ash fruit bearing trees
in towns and fields for fruit, and 
scavenge whatever plantlife you can
outside. That armor is not going to
come to you if you keep eating cakes
and pies. 

-The meat of many monsters is edible.
Women love Putit flesh for what it 
does for their skin. Some isn't so
good for you, but if you're hungry...

-While succulent and tasting of young
pork, the flesh of man should not be
eaten. Only crazy people eat people,
and you aren't crazy are you?

-Innkeepers for coin can feed you
quite nicely. They have beds too.

-Until you can buy/find/steal a bed
for your home, stay at inns when you
are tired. A sleeping bag is a good
idea for deep dungeon trekking.

-Should a pet or ally fall in battle,
most towns have a bartender who can
bring them back for a price.

-Check your 'j'ournal! It has all the
information about quests you are on,
jobs you are doing, events, your own
reputation and bills. Check it often.

-On the subject of bills. When you
become famous enough, you'll get a
salary of money and items twice a
month. The salary will be dropped off
in the chest in your home. However,
with salary also comes taxes. Take 
the bill in hand and cash in pocket 
to the local embassy just north of 
Palmia and pay it there. Don't let 
your bills add up as the taxmen are 
worse than any dragon or demon.

-Should your skills start to plateau,
seek a trainer. There is one in every
town, and will sharpen your existing
skills. They also have skills you do
not yet possess and for a price will
teach you them. Beware though, they
only accept platinum coins, and those
are in short supply these days.

-And finally, beware the weather. Oh,
a little rain may have never killed
anybody, but with heavy rain comes 
lightning that can blind you and the
great thunder which can confuse you.
Try not to get lost while in one.
Sometimes, the best thing to do is
stay in place till your head clears.
Rarely, but with increasing fervor is
the dreaded Etherwind. Beware this.
A friend of mine was stuck outside in
it and could barely be called human
when he finally staggered inside.
When it comes, FIND SHELTER! I cannot
stress this enough. Hide in a cave if
the monsters inside won't tear you to
bits. If you are in a town you are by
no means safe. Run to the innkeeper
and demand Shelter. Wait out the evil
storms, and only after it passes can
you return to your duties.







In closing, I hope this is of some
use to you, and I hope my final
adventure is a good one. Now if you
will excuse me, I have a fort to
conquer. How bad could it be?

Good luck to you and your travels.

博物馆经营指南
	written by 标本狂

　对经营博物馆很好奇？给想经营博物馆
的你几条建议。

　博物馆，是通过向来客展示稀有的标本
和卡片来赚取收入的设施。不管在博物馆
里的哪都可以，只要把上述物品摆放出来
就应该可以确认到博物馆当前的排名了。

　每只标本或卡片都有着各自不同的稀有
度。越是巨大的标本、越是难以获得的
独特卡片，就越有其稀有价值。

　需要注意的是，重叠在一起的物品将无
法被展出。并且，所有种类重复的道具的
稀有价值，将从第二个开始降低。

那么，请努力经营吧。我期待着你的博物
馆成为人们的话题传到我耳中的那天哦。

ps. 喔喔、差一点就忘了。初建时的博物
馆很狭窄，觉得地方不够用的时候，就挖
开墙壁来扩建吧。

Museum Administration Manual Mk.II
ReWritten by Curator Schmidt

So you want to run a Museum do you?

Young Sir/Lady, it takes some hefty
capital to purchase such a deed, but
if you have the time, patience, and
money this old curator will help you
out with this handy, unbiased manual.

In your wanton and overly hedonistic
destruction of the local flora and 
fauna (henceforth known in this guide
as "adventuring") you might have come
across some of the following:

Item a.) Figure of <Fauna>
Item b.) Card   of <Fauna>

If so, then you may have barely given
them a glance before shoving them in
your sack if ill-gotten gains and 
simply gone back to "adventuring".
No doubt you have sold them for more
tankards of ale and legs of mutton,
but the more intelligent among you
might collect them into a pile and 
ponder "Why do monsters have these?"

The answer: Vanity! And Magic!

And it is these things that we shall
profit from. And it's so simple even
an adventurer can do it!

Still, just in case, I have written 
down the exact steps to minimize any
unfortunate mishaps that might arise.

Step 1.) Purchase a deed of a Museum.
   This step is what chokes out the
   small fry from the serious doers.
   
Step 2.) 'r'ecite the deed upon the
   spot on the world you wish your
   museum to be. Let the gnomes do
   the building, it won't take long.

Step 3.) Aesthetically place all the 
   Cards and Figures you have found
   inside the museum. Neatness is a
   virtue, though not necessary.

Step 4.) Profit!

That should do it as far as the basic
setup requires. If you want even more
information about specific queries, 
merely read on to learn more!
      -== Notes and Caveats ==-

Whilst having more than one museum is
certainly possible, only your first
one will make any money. 

Figures are worth more than cards
most times anyway.

Don't pile multiple items upon one
space. It is entirely unprofessional,
and utterly ineffectual.

The mightier the monster, the better
value the card and Figure. Rare are
the Cards with a Name or Title on 
them. These indeed are best.

While having a dragon's card is nice.
having ten is just tacky. Variety is
key. The more duplicates you have,
the less they are worth.

Oh and one more thing... the gnomes
that build your museum have somewhat,
oh, narrow tastes. you may have to 
purchase a <designer board> to sculpt
it into your own grandiose vision.

            -== Errata ==-
Base cost: 		140,000 gp
Maintenance cost:    1500 gp/month
Income per rank:      100 gp/month

**Figures above are approximates only


Happy Curating!

Crimberry Addiction and You	
A Schmidt Education Pamphlet

Every year more and more people are
becoming addicted to the seemingly
harmless Crimberry.

Known by an ancient Nefian dialect as
Kur-amu-beri, which should just go to
show its long and sordid history with
our land and peoples, the Crimberry 
is a strong hallucinogen with many
different applications.

Simply eating a berry can cause the
following symptoms in 15 to 60mins:
- Hallucinations
- Impairment like Drunkenness
- Raving like a loon
- Fever-like motor-control failure.
Crimberries are highly addictive, and
should the addict fail to get his
next "Crim", he will either turn to
other narcotics, or become a threat
to our community.

And of course, no one thinks of the
poor children who get involved in our
seemingly "adult" activities. They've
even created a new way to "enjoy" the
devilish berries; 

They copy the wild yeeks and dry them
then shove the dried berry up their
nose. This "snorting" of Crimberries
will lead to the proliferation of 
excess aggression, and will lead more
desparate individuals to become known
as "adventurers" commiting insane
deeds to get their next fix.
While some of the older, long haired
Wizards demand that Crimberries remin
legalized, if only for their sacred
"rituals", this must stop!

        FOR OUR CHILDREN!
        
        FOR OUR FUTURE!

Blessed Herbs
Chronicled by Dr. Schmidt, PhDM

* Curaria [KYURARIA AQUIFOLIUM]
Effect is well known and medicinal.
However, the ability of said effects
is based entirely on it's so called
"consecrated" state, which has been 
clinically proven to be a real effect
and not merely a placebo.
Effect Status: Life Restorant

* Morgia [MOJIA DIPSACUS PILOSUS]
Massive hormone Stimulant. Increases 
muscle mass, strength and endurance.
Blind-Test subjects recieved various
"consecrated" state herbs and thusly
recieved differing returns. This only
goes to prove that Gods do in fact
exist, and that all our science is 
meaningless in their might.
Effect Status: Strength and Endurance
	       enhancers

* Mareilon [MAREIRON DIPSACUS FEROX]
Neuro-Chemical stimulant. Increases
cognitive abilities. Level of effect
entirely on "consecrated" state.
Effect Status: Mental Enhancement

* Spenseweed [SUPENSUUIDO LONGIFOLIA]
All effects as of yet are unknown,
though it has been noted that those
who ingest it seem to be more "aware"
and levels of perception may be up.
More testing is needed to determine
all side effects.
Effect Status: Enchanced Perception



* Alraunia [ARURONIA MARTYNIA LUTEA]
Hormone-activated. Aphrodiasiac. 
Thus extremely popular with the 
locals. Oddly enough, it also appears
to have some ability at improving 
memory. Research still pending grant.
Effect Status: Memory improvement,
               Libido enhancement

* Stomafilla [SUTOMAFIRIA HYPOGAEA]
Upon contact with the stomach, the
herb expands and fills the cavity,
leading the consumer to feel very 
"bloated". Long term use and the 
nutritional level of the plant has
yet to be verified. 

Effect Status: Very Filling


As more specimens are brought in and
tested, so shall we update this brief
guide.

Until then,

店的运作指南
	written by 熟练的店长

　店的运作没有你想象中的那么困难。先把
商品陈列好，再雇个有魅力的店长，然后就
可以坐等定期的销售报告了。写长篇大论实
在太麻烦了，所以就只写几条提示好了。

* 来客的人数和店主的魅力，以及店面的等
级成正比。

* 店面的等级，会随着贩卖品的数量达到一
定程度而上升。

* 店面的等级越高，来客就会带着越鼓的钱
包来消费。

* 因此，店面等级低的时候，高价的道具是
无法卖去的。

* 家具和货车里的货物不能拿来卖。

　最后提醒一下，落到商店地面上的物品是
会被自动当成商品的，千万不要因此而丢失
了重要的物品。

Shop Owning and Operational manual
ReWritten by Schmidt the Fence

So, you think you can own a shop? I
know, sitting on your arse all day
hawking wares seems easy enough. 

But then riddle me this genius:
If it's so easy, why is there only 
one shop per type in every town?

The answer is simple: 
      Only the strong Survive!
(Well, that and the high taxes...)

Store operation is so difficult, 
only the meanest and cut-throat can
survive in town. You however, have 
an advantage over us town-shops:
     You will be outside!
And while that sounds less than ideal
right now, your monthly payments to
the crown are cut down to a mere
Five Thousand Gold Pieces a Month
(5000gp/Month)
Which is peanuts to what us city
shops have to pay, believe you me.

     -== Setting up a Shop ==-
Step 1.) Buy a deed of a shop.
 (A Mere 200,000gp at a base price.)

Step 2.) 'r'ead the deed aloud on the
spot of the world you would like it
to be built on.

Step 3.) Set up the shop (see below)

Step 4.) Caveat Emptor!

     -== Running your Shop ==-
Your shop is up and now it must be
run, which is a separate process.

First you need a shopkeeper. Now this
cannot be you, as you have to out and
get the things to sell. So you have
to go and get one of your companions
to do it. You should choose a worker
based on how good they look, and how
good a negotiator they are, as they
are the vital two things in any good
sale. Now that you have such a goon,
go to the register in the shop.
Assign that person to the job. 

The other part is also simple, to 
SELL Stuff you need to HAVE stuff.
So go get stuff and and leave it in
your shop. The better stuff should
be out on display, the less good bits
should be in a pile in the back in 
your shop strongbox.

-== Little Golden Nuggets of Info ==-

Your Salesperson stays at the shop
and cannot come with you.

Selling stuff makes money(natch) but
it also improves your rank, which can
make you even more money.

Due to a vicious spat with the local
Furniture Union, we cannot sell any
spare furniture out of town. We in
town can still buy and sell it. 

Anything else, garbage, junk, even
rotten stuff can be sold if you can 
find a sucker for it.

Investigate your allies to find the
prettiest and bestest negotiator. It
may be 10,000gp to do so, but having
the best salesperson available will
make up for it in the long run.

The Embassy north of Palmia sells a
fair bit of equipment for shops if
you need anything.

Due to your shop permit, you can ONLY
sell a maximum of 10 items at a time.
You can expand on this for a mere
2000gp for an additional ten slots,
and every subsequent 1000gp for each
10 slots after.


       -== Fiscal Information ==-
Base cost:            200,000 gp
Maintenance cost:     5,000 gp/month
Income per rank:      ??? gp/month**

**Why ??? for income? 'Cause that's 
where you come in bub!

With luck, you too will be living
large like me!

Remember: The GP stops here!

Good Business to you!

第一次的自家栽培
	written by 农民

　自给自足…真是一个好词。想把农业当成
副业或是趣味来玩玩看？那我就来教你一些
简单的自家栽培方法吧。

　首先，比什么都重要的是选择好种植的时
期和地点。时期能选在下雨的时候是最好不
过的，地点的话当然是选在农田里了。在下
雨的日子里播种的种子不容易枯萎，而农田
的土地会增加收获果实时留下种芽的概率。

　成功地完成了播种之后，就关注着种子的
成长吧。顺利的话，种子会在土中生出根来
经过半个月到一个月的时间后结出果实。栽
培技术低的时候，经常会发生种子在成长中
途干枯的情况，这时候请不要灰心。

　最后就是翘首以盼的收获了。嗯…先把这
点记住吧：已经结出果实的种子是不会枯萎
的。

　收获是最考验栽培能力的时候，如果你的
技巧相当高，说不定收获后植物会留下新芽。

栽培能力越高收获的蔬菜或者水果的品质就
越高。不过相应的，会引来以上等作物为目
标的野生动物。击退一次的话暂时就不会再
过来了…。

在南提里斯有很多奇妙的植物种子。有机会
的话请务必买来种在自己的田里，开始享受
起自给自足的新生活吧。

ps  也有雨天更适合进行收获的传闻。实际
上有没有效果完全是个谜。搞不好只是当事
人的心理作用。

Crop Growin' Fer City-Slickers
by Jebediah Schmidt

So you reckon on joining us good folk
in doin' an honest days work do ya?

Well, you adventurers-types with yer
big-ol' swords and fancy armor, might
not got enough grit ta get the job
done right, but we'll give you a shot
at join us humble folk.

Ta start, you need ta have a green-
Thumb, or "Gardening Skills" in your
fancy city speak. If ya don't have 
that skill afore a-startin' out ya
gots a Yeek's chance on a skillet to
get any plantin' done. So go get ta
learnin' that first.

Next, since we got all the good land
near the towns, ya'll have to set up
elsewhere. Now, I could go on all day
about what my Pappy and his Pappy say
about soil, but I know you won't get
but a yeek bite's worth of it, so 
allow me to "summ-ar-ize" it fer ya:

Time and Place. Them's crucial.

Ya'll might've noticed it rains more
at certain times of the year. Thems
the seasons, and the rainier it is,
the better fer yer crops. 

Place is easy. You might notice we
like to plant on flat plains. There's
a good reason fer it, and ya'll soon
prolly figger out what it is. Avoid
Snow, Mountains, and the only good
thing that came from a forest is more
trees, not crops.

Now buy a deed and claim yer land.
Come Hell or High Ether it's yers!

But Jebidah, ya sez, I ain't gots no
seeds tah plant! Kin I have some o'
yers? I'd say heck no! Seeds is the 
lifeblood of any crop! Go finds yer
own! Ya get seeds rarely, unless you 
heads North near the Alter and finds 
ya some.

Once ya got some seeds, ya needs ta
plant 'em. Now I like doin' it in the
rain, as I reckon it's better for em.
Jes stand in yer fields and 't'ool em
into the soil all gentle like. Easy.
Now, after that, ya gotta wait, as 
they take time ta grow. 

Thanks to that there Etherwind, crops
only take about a week or so nowadays
which gets my Pappy all in a tiff it
does, as he reckons it oughta take a
whole season like it did in his time
and his Pappy's time. Anyhoo, after 
they grow and get ripe, ya gots ta 
pick em. At first ya'll bumble a bit,
but once you get good enough, ya jus'
might find more seeds once ya pick em
rightly good enough.

Then ya'll go and do it again!

     -== Bits from my Pappy ==-
Now some crops'll wither, and that's 
life, so no grumblin' about fate and
the winds and all that hackey-dackey.
It'll happen less if ya bless ya seed
AFORE ya go and plant it! Practice
also helps keep the wither away too.

'g'et yer crops when theys ripe, also
'g'et yer withered ones away too as
ya never know if it's a catchy sick.

Seed Types:
Fruit seed: grows them there fruits
Vegetable seed: grows them vegetables
Herb seed: Ah reckon it grows herbs
Gem seed: grow ores and gems, honest!
Unknown seed: ? Never Grew one o dese
Artifact seed: Grows Fancy artifacts

If ya needs seeds, and I know no real
farmer that dain't, ya should worship
Kumiromi. She likes her offerings all
mushy-like, and there's always scraps
ya don't need much.

My Pappy's Unca once said that if ya
'g'et yer crops in the rain it's gets 
ya right better crop. Now I never was
one to go pickin' in the rain, so's I
don'ts knows fer sure iffin it's true
or not. 

      -== Them Numbery Bits ==-
Deed: Bout' Forty Thousand or so
      Pends on your yackin' n' dackin
Now my Grammy, she could get a deal.
Ya shoulda seen her get TWO sacks a
Potatah's for one jug o' CrimShine.
Course', our Still was made by my
Pappy's Cousin's Unca. Still, with
Crimberries bein' frowned on as crops
ya have ta plant them all sneaky like
in the back behind squash...

You Water Wasting Jackals! Curse you!

Where I come from water is life! 
Waterholes are protected to the death
down to the last woman and child!

I come to this country, and what do I
see? Water, nay, LIFE, being wasted!
You people, who live in such lushes,
waste so much it's sinful!

Water should be blessed, given to all
your gods as tribute! Do you people
even know all the things you can do
with dirty water? 

I suspect not.

Nor will you if you simply toss it

对畜牧的建议
	written by 畜牧大师

　嗯…其实我不擅长写书的…不过想赚些版
费…而且也闲得没事干…

　说起畜牧……我最早继承家业的时候也曾有
过浪漫的梦想，但现实只是接连不断的给我
这个新手带来教训。首先。不得不跨越的第
一道难关是要想办法得到畜种。畜种是啥…？
顾名思义，就是能不断产下新的幼仔的生物
把生物登陆为畜种之后，这个物种就会随着
时间推移逐渐变得兴旺起来。

　刚开始的时候，推荐养鸡啊羊啊之类的野
声动物。野生动物的繁殖能力基本上都很强
怪兽的话，越强的生物，繁殖成功的概率似
乎就越低。

　虽然家畜只要进行放牧，它就会自由的生
活，但是如果想要获得健康的肉质最好用家
畜用的大型刷子来定期的为它刷洗，温柔的
抚摸这类的养殖技巧也是必要的。

  具有特性的家畜有时也会增加。具有什么
样的特性，要在刷洗的时候通过触诊来判断
就会明白。根据作为种畜的家畜的状态不同
能够发挥出的特性遗传给后代的也不同。  

　尽量让牧场中保持整洁。因为产蛋和榨取
乳汁是需要用到一定空间的…还有，家畜如
过实在太多的话，也是会让产蛋产乳率下降
的。20匹左右差不多是恰当的数量吧？适当
地弃掉一些幼仔也是可以的。

　家畜增加之后能用来做什么呢，随你喜欢
了…因为家畜随时都可以带出来，卖给奴隶商
人也可以哦。或者杀掉家畜剥下肉来，这样
就不用担心食物的问题了。肉腐烂了？…没那
回事…那种时候就要…（字太脏了无法阅读）

　宰杀家畜的时候，偶尔会让其他家畜变得
躁动不安，这种时候只要离开牧场一次再回
来，一切就都会平复下来了。

　说明大概就是这么多了吧…反正畜牧也不
会花太多的工夫，你也考虑一下把畜牧当
成副业吧？

A Ranching guide for the Greenhorns
	2nd Edition
	By Cattle Baron Schmidt

Howdy all! I write this guide for the
same reason I rustle cattle about:
Money. Plenty of good royalties to be
had if one takes the time to put pen
to paper. Still, while I can't give
ALL my secrets to you as it'd put me
out of business, but I can't get you
to by my next book if I don't give at
least the basics.

To begin with, you'll at least eighty
thousand or so to purchase a deed to
a ranch. Less, if you are a good 
talker or rather attractive.


Then, with deed in hand, find the 
best place for it you can find. While
it cannot be within town limits, as
you do NOT want people asking nosy
questions on what exactly it is you 
are breeding, or other such moral or 
ethical-type dilemmas.

Once you are at the spot of choice,
merely 'r'ead the deed and claim your
land.

-== The Joys & Perils of Breeding ==-

Good Breeding is a fine art, and is
what separates us from the savages.
No where more true is this rule than
at a ranch.


Any animal assigned to be a "breeder"
will stay on the ranch, and, in time,
produce milk, eggs, shit, and other
bits. And no, I am not going to try 
to explain how mammals will lay eggs
or how exactly you milk a twenty-ton
firebreathing lizard. I don't rightly
try to answer those sort of questions
and frankly, neither should you.
Just accept the fact and move on.

Now, those items can be sold for fair
coin, but the real profit is in the
breeding and rightly so. This isn't a
farm after all. Now, with the coming 
of the Etherwind, breeding has become
a very simple process. Not like the
old days, when you had to keep track
of bloodlines, and breeding seasons,
and listen to the mating howls, and
the awful thumping of not one but two
Twenty-ton Carnivores going at it.
All. Night. Long.

But I digress. Now all you do is just
assign it breeding duties, and let it
be. Soon, there will be more of them.
Mitosis? Magic? Again these are the
questions you should not rightly ask.

Generally speaking, wild animals -
chickens, sheep, rabbits and the like
- breed like rabbits. Heh. Another
thing to keep in mind is that the
more powerful a monster is, the
slower it'll breed on your ranch.
That's something to remember when
choosing what to breed if you need a
gazillion more of them.

I did say that all you have to do to
get them to breed is to leave them
to their own devices. But. If you
want to get really good quality stuff,
what you have to do is brush them
once in a while. Grab a big brush,
and give them a nice rubbing. Of
course, you need to know how to
do the Rub special 'a'ction in order
for you to do that.

Sometimes you'll manage to breed
one of them farm animals that are
really good at something. I don't
mean maths or anything. They might
be good at putting out oodles and
oodles of milk or eggs. Or maybe
they'll have good meat or skin.
You'll know what they're good or bad
at by paying attention during
brushing. Those qualities will be
exhibited while they're on the
ranch. If they're the breeder, they'll
produce more animals with similar
qualities.

You'll want to keep the ranch clean.
Ranch animals need space to lay
eggs and uh... milk themselves. Can't
do that if there's shit all over the
place, can they?

It's a good idea to keep an eye on
the number of animals on the ranch.
They don't breed as fast and also
produce less milk and eggs when
the ranch is full of animals. I find
20 animals optimal number. See if
you can't find a nice balance for
your ranches too.

    -== Fruits of Your Labour ==-

Now, these... offspring, can be used
in several ways, which I shall list
below:

'i'nteract with it and get it to join
you on your travels.

Gene Engineering with zero risk to 
the originals.

Profit by taking it to a slave trader
if, I might add, you know where to go
where no one asks any questions.

Or you can kill it and the odds of a
carcass being salvageable is much 
better than duking it out in the wild.

-== The Drydock. Waste Nothing ==-

A benefit of having a ranch is having
a drydock at your disposal. Now I put
mine in the southeast corner so the 
wind will blow the stench away from
my estate. I assume it will be the 
same for you (you'd best hope so).
In any other trade a rotten carcass
would be nothing but a loss. Not so
with a ranch, where nothing goes to
waste. Simply dump your rotten meat
into the drydock to cure, and in no
time at all you'll have delicious,
lightweight, adventurer-sought-after
Jerky!



	-== In Conclusion ==-

At this point a wise man would stop
writing here, and just let you dream.
Simply imagine the possibilities, and
then grasp them.

In my next book, which will be soon
available, I will highlight the more
subtle tricks to the trade, like how
exactly you prevent a twenty-ton, 
fire-breathing, living force of
Destruction and Death from simply
leaving the ranch after setting all
to the flame and devouring you on the
spot for asking it to sit there and
breed.

Until then Partners!

You have gotten a bit of a name for

Wily Mujaf's Thesis
	by <Caim>

I saw the town get turned into a 
smouldering pile of rubble. I was
hoping for just one more chance.
Fact is, I didn't get it. Because
over and over again she fought lions,
refusing to die. Look, her rib cage's
still intact and everything. Didn't
eat into it at all. Good as new.
Crazy stuff, if you ask me. Now, you
receive four options. First is 
especially attractive and will not
try to kill you. Next up, stunning...
character to go with her looks. Third
has a habit of lazing around. Lastly,
a loyal mage who will go walk over
red-hot embers for you. I wish I were
anywhere but here. Actually, I
CAN run away. RIGHT NOW. Alright,
time to haul butt. You guys aren't
ever taking me alive. I'm gonna keep
running. Over and out.
















10 thousand gp. More than enough to
wash away everything. I want to
forget these memories that are still
raw. Seems like it was just the
other day when it happened. But as
much I would like to forget, I can't.
Could I have stopped everything that
happened? She's never coming back
anyway. I would have gone insane
over the sight of people bleeding,
scratching their faces off. Flecks of
skin flying. It was quite the
headache for everyone in town, from
royalty to the peasants. Now
if only aliens were violent tourist
neighbours, storing shapeshifting

奈菲亚综合症
	written by 泽那恩精神医生

奈菲亚综合症，就是在奈菲亚内出现的一种
精神疾病。

・症状
　大概有三个阶段，再之后会生命垂危。


阶段１
　判断力降低。
　其降低会有个体差异、经常有无视迷宫
内有益道具，变得会经常冲入敌阵中央，
但是不会影响到城镇内的生活。这个阶段
的多为活跃着的冒险者。

阶段２
　认知力降低，变得无法客观的看待事物。
有很多人变得不能认知到楼梯，因此困在
迷宫里回不了家。

阶段３
　攻击性增强。
　在这个阶段的同族或同伴会变得积极的向
你攻击。
　原理不明，相同阶段3的人基本不会自相残
杀。虽然发病者有时会形成群体，但互相看起
来并不认识。
　本身攻击性极低的人在这个阶段看起来没有
变化。


　阶段2的患者会一直在奈菲亚内徘徊，有时
地壳变动后会与奈菲亚一起沉入地底。不过也
有不少逃出迷宫的人。

・大致原因
　有人说原因是奈菲亚的魔力，有人说是地磁
力，哪种看起来似乎都有可能，但缺乏证据。
　长久居住会引起症状恶化，但个体差异十分
明显。
　特别是冒险者与一些又名号的人，大多都处
在阶段1。不明原因发病的人也有不少。
　不管怎样，只要不是易感体质，就能好好的
作为冒险者活动。

・对策
　现在并没有治疗方法。
　但有进行高耐性体质者与其他人的研究。
　比如失去统帅的部队很容易发病，所以精
神状态会影响病症。
　发病的人离开奈菲亚的话症状就会减轻。

・大众认知
　从古代开始人们就认为奈菲亚很危险，但
不是基于奈菲亚综合症的判断。
　认为清理奈菲亚内怪物没有什么危险的人
也很多，过于自信结果发病的人从古至今都
是源源不断的。（＊１）。
　一些国家禁止国民踏足奈菲亚，也会让军
队做一些处理，但还远远不够。

A Review on Nefian Psychosis
	by a Zanan Psychologist

Nefian Psychosis is a mental disorder
that develops in some people when
they are within a Nefia (commonly
known as a dungeon).

       -=Signs and symptoms=-
The disorder presents itself in three
stages, each of which are described
below, with the latter stages being
more serious.

       -=Stage 1 psychosis=-
Characterized by lowered cognitive
ability. The decrease in cognitive
ability varies between patients, but
they will typically be lacking in
their object recognition ability and
ignore useful items on the ground or
charge blindly into enemies.

Nevertheless, many adventurers are
able to maintain a high quality of
life in towns while afflicted with
this stage of the disorder.

       -=Stage 2 psychosis=-
Extremely low object recognition
ability, with a complete inability
to recognize some classes of objects.
Many afflicted by this stage of the
disorder are unable to recognize
staircases, and experience great
difficulty in finding their way home.




       -=Stage 3 psychosis=-
Marked by increased aggressiveness.
At this stage, patients actively
target and exhibit aggression towards
other people, including acquaintances
and former allies. For reasons yet
unknown, Stage 3 patients do not
attack one another.

Some of the afflicted band together
to form working groups, so it appears
that they are somehow able to
recognize one another. It has also
been observed that individuals who
displayed no aggressive behaviour
before the onset of the disorder do
not display any aggression whatsoever
even at this stage.

Many individuals suffering from Stage
2 psychosis may get trapped in
dungeons, but there are many reports
of such individuals suddenly
reappearing aboveground when the
dungeon sinks into the crust.

          -=Hypothesis=-
Two hypotheses have offered to
explain this phenomenon, namely that
it results either from exposure to
mana in dungeons or to a particular
type of magnetic field. Neither of
these explanations, however, have
proved to be completely satisfactory.
Though is indeed a strong and
positive correlation between the
amount of time spent in dungeons and
the severity of psychosis, it does
not account for the high variability
in the speed and severity of onset of
psychosis between individuals.

Many afflicted adventurers also never
progress beyond Stage 1, and many
more never develop psychosis at all.
It is possible that individuals who
become adventurers are inherently less
likely to be predisposed to the
disorder.

 -=Prevention of Nefian Psychosis=-
There is no cure for Nefian Psychosis
at the time of writing. However,
research has shown that recruiting
allies who are not predisposed to
psychosis can offer some protection
against the disorder. There has also
been a case where an entire group of
individuals developed the disorder
after losing their commander, so it
is commonly thought that mood and
the mental state of individuals
play an important part in both
the progression and prevention of
the disorder.

Some individuals also experience an
improvement in their condition after
avoiding dungeons for a period of
time.

       -=Public perception=-
The notion that dungeons are
dangerous is well-entrenched in
society since ancient times, but few
will associate Nefian Psychosis
with that danger. It is a common
misconception that dungeons are
innocuous without the monsters that
reside within them, as there have
been many documented cases of
skilled dungeon-delvers coming down
with the disorder since ancient
times (see footnote 1).
 
For that reason, some countries
forbid entrance to dungeons while
others limit dungeon access to
the military, but these measures
still fall short of preventing
cases of Nefian Psychosis.









Footnote 1:
The earliest record of such a case
was an inscription discovered in
Kjaraht, dating back to 3000 years
ago. A well-known dungeon conquerer
became deranged and it was suspected
that he was possessed by a dungeon,
leading to his eventual execution.

Gifting Gifts
	by a Travelling Merchant

What is it that you do when you would
like to give someone a gift? Do you
sometimes get lazy and give it to
them by hand instead of placing it
at their feet?

If it's for someone close like a Soul
Mate, or if you are in a terrible
hurry, then that's fair enough.
However, many of the elderly find it
rather offensive to be handed items.

It is polite to place items at
peoples' feet in most areas. Of
course, you don't have to go that far
for your family members.

One thing you should keep in mind is
that it is rude to place items at
peoples' feet in parts of the
Asserian continent. When visiting

An Exercise in Team-Building
	by Lead Instructor

For today's practice, you will be
pairing up with someone else to form
a tag team.

Now grab a buddy. The one on the left
will be in charge of movement.

If you're fighting a battle in a tag
team, watch how your partner moves.
If you're fighting someone strong,
pay special attention to how you move
during the fight, and I guarantee
you'll learn lots from it.

When taking fire, whoever has the
most health at that moment should
take damage for the other. And don't
forget! Split any gold you pick up
with your partner.

Walk at the same speed to make sure
you don't trip. You there, you don't
have to tie your legs together! Put
that rope away.

What? You don't have a partner?
Alright, you can tag with me.

Adventurers Quarterly (Spring 518)
	by Edelia the maid, age 12

Hello there. I am Edelia the maid.
How do you do? Today I bring to you
advice that will hopefully prove to be
of use in your adventures.

There are many types of furniture
that are indispensable to every
home. No home should be without beds,
cooking utensils, and storage
containers.

Some furniture like bookshelves can
be used as a (t)ool. Yet others -
fridges for example - are storage
containers that can be (o)pened.
These will prove useful in keeping
your home clutter-free.

Before buying a new deed and moving
house for a change of pace, how about
looking over your house and seeing
if you can't sort things out?

仇恨的笔记本
	written by 泽那恩研究员

　今天，被所长叫过去，还以为有什么事， 
原来是去别研究所的转属命令
　现在的工作是昆虫兵器的研究。虽说只是
下层人员，身为这里担当者的我不在的话会
人手不足的。而且听说转属地是做利用菌强
化人体的研究。
总觉得很危险啊…。
　虽然我坚决拒否，但那已是决定了的事情
我的想法就被那样轻视。打心底不可原谅。
---------------------------------------

　新的研究所里，都是比之前那些更加疯狂
的家伙。我还想究竟是从哪里收集到这些实
验体的，没想到居然是从那些用欺诈行为使
之破产的家庭那里强行买来的。
仔细看被验者中连小孩子都有。
打心底不可原谅。
　用欺诈集来的钱做预算多了一大把，那所
长很开心的说着。这什么职场啊！一想到在
这种地方工作…真是流亡他国的心情都有。
　但是全副武装的守卫都擦亮了眼睛，可能
是戒备着发生生化危机，连一只蚂蚁出去的
缝隙都不留。看来不打倒守卫，或破坏墙壁
就没法逃出去了…。
---------------------------------------

　被验者们被关在名为个室的独房里，被用
号码称呼，监视着。这简直是是囚犯啊。明
明只是受到欺诈什么事都没做错啊，我向前
辈们说过之后，得到了被骗的家伙才有错的
这种胡话。
　结果，既然你同情那就去和它们一起愉快
聊天吧，就这样我强行变成了今晚检查被验
者的值班了。打心底不可原谅。
---------------------------------------

　我勉强着去检查，发现了我的被验者们一
个个都对我破口大骂。虽然我对他们什么都
没做，但从他们来看我也是敌人吧。什么叫
一起愉快聊天啊。
　回去时，在走廊深处传来了哭泣以及安慰
它的声音。说来有对兄妹是被相邻收容起来
了。
　虽是紧揪胸口的思想，但我还是怕回去对
话后，被他们责怪。
…我，对这样的自己打心底不可原谅。
---------------------------------------

　怎么会这样，在这里研究的居然是魔蝎拉
的人体控制！虽然确实是菌没错，但这和军
方提出的资料不一样啊。
　好像是打算做魔蝎拉的研究却被制止过，
即使如此现在还在背后秘密的进行研究，就
是说，打算弄出莫大的成果让军方哑口无言
吧。
　感觉还会出什么问题。还是先看看吧。
---------------------------------------

　还想着到底如何控制魔蝎拉，看来是以神
经系统的强化为主。对肉体的变化毫不出手
干涉，还反过来直接利用那点。
　因细菌侵蚀神经后身体会擅自动起来，这
貌似是通过人体改造和药物投用来进行控制。
现阶段可以说，全员都是已经过改造手术的
了。
　理论上是可行的，但在成功之时被验者岂
不是会不听我们话暴动起来呢？
刚想了下，实际利用这个技术的应该是士兵。
被验者充其量只是弃子一旦确保技术就会被
当做垃圾处理了吧。打心底不可原谅。
---------------------------------------

　今天所内都手忙脚乱。中午突然从军方本
部有人来视察了。
看来是非常急忙焦虑，连让新人的我都帮忙
做些隐蔽的工作了。我知道了那些过程。令
人作呕般打心底不可原谅的黑色问题不停的
涌出。
我一边进行作业，让那些谨记于头脑。
---------------------------------------

　来视察的，据说是那位红之英雄的部下，
说到红之英雄那是一位普通有名的军人，
在研究员之间那可是能令人怀疑生化兵器的
实用性而出名之人。曾经我也有因昆虫兵器
的预算被消减而有过痛苦的回忆。
　不管什么都好，这可是能捣毁这腐败研究
所的机会啊！我急忙把所有的问题点都写下，
成功把它交给了正在回去的视察官。总算是
赶上了。
　这就是所谓的内部告发吧。自从来到这里
就一直是与世隔离无法和外部取得联系的状
态，也只有这样做了。
　接下来就只有祈祷别让人发现是我告发的，
和在被验者中出现牺牲之前能了结此事了…。
---------------------------------------

　糟了。所长看来对这次的视察感到了焦虑
加速实验把它提前了。
　可恶，前辈们在喊快去做实验的准备。
就没有什么办法吗!



---------------------------------------

　…结果，我没法立刻着手工作只能按照指
示做着准备。
　全被验者的魔蝎拉都活性化后，向他们投
下了药物。如果是没有经过改造的人类一下
子就会变成废人了，看来这烈药可不是虚有
其表，马上全员都开始痛苦了。虽然也可能
是魔蝎拉的作用反应。
　除我之外的研究员全部，都用期待的眼神
看着痛苦不堪的被验者们。虽然着手兵器开
发的我没有资格谈论人道，但总觉得莫名火
大。打心底不可原谅。
---------------------------------------

　实验开始经过2小时后，出现了变化。
有的体色出现了变化，有的长出了触手。他
们用所长的说法貌似是「适配率低的渣屑」。
人渣是你才对。
　在其他的被验者痛苦之时，只有14号倒地
不起一动不动。身体没有出现任何变异被认
为是适合体，总觉得有些奇怪。收到指令，
为了调查所以要把他搬到别室。
　真没办法，稍微去下吧。
---------------------------------------

　我们在把他搬出隔离区域的瞬间，14号一
跃而起！看来那是所谓的装死。虽然是老办
法，但在这个状况可以说是效果拔群。
　14号用不可置信的怪力打飞了守卫，就算
受到了攻击也会瞬间再生。
　他的话是不是可以强行正面突破逃出呢？
抱有此想法的我，马上指着出口大叫到。
别让他逃了，加固防守出口。
　看来14号理解了出口的位置，把聚集起来
的守卫一个个打倒出去了。看来一切顺利。
---------------------------------------

　啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊！我真是笨蛋！！
那么强的话说不定可以一个人就压制这个研
究所啊！
　14号好像逃过了追兵，但这让研究所的警
备系统大幅强化了。这样下去16号…救他的
妹妹也会很困难吧。
　这哪里是一切顺利，啊。为什么我那时没
有想到这点呢。打心底不可原谅…。
---------------------------------------

　现在，我对人类的丑陋已感到厌倦。


　实验开始已经过了12小时，或许还有其他
适合者于是开始了再次巡逻。我也是其人员
之一。
　边想着如果有适合者该怎么把他带出隔离
区域边来到了独房前，发生了令人惊愕的事。
　被验者们的身体已经开始变异成茧的姿态。
其他的研究员叫喊道。这个形态是预想之外
的，12小时能变异到此程度也是预想之外。
　急急忙忙用无线电向外面的家伙传达了现
在的状况后，响起了很大的声音。以为发生
什么而巡视四周的我们，看到了隔离区的隔
壁降了下来。最尾端的研究员急忙跑过来时，
隔壁已经完全降了下来。
　无线电、没有回复。
---------------------------------------

　对绝望的我们，茧毫不留情的伸出触手向
我们来袭。。总算是全员都避开致命伤后退
到了隔壁附近，这样下去谁都无法得救。
　从深处，传来了某种冲击音。
是被验者暴走，在敲打墙壁吗？
虽然很在意怎么回事，但我还是没有避开那
些触手潜入深处的勇气。
　我抛下那些开始发狂大笑的家伙，躲在角
落的家伙，写着这文章。

Bitter Last Words
	of a Zanan Researcher

The chief called me in today. Turns
out I'm going to be transferred to
another research facility. Why?
We're so close to perfecting our
weaponized insects! I may be low on
the management hierarchy, but I'm
still the one in charge of my team.
We're not going to have enough
people here if I get transferred.
What's worse is that this facility
I'm going to is conducting research
on bacterial human augmentation.
That term itself gives me the chills.

This is an order so I can't just say
no to it, but it really pisses me
off how they made that decision
without consulting me. And now
they mention it to me in passing
as if it were no big deal.

Damn it.















        -------------------

The people at this new facility are
crazy. And considering where I used
to work, that's saying a lot. I
wondered where they were getting
their subjects from. Turns out they
swindled money from people, then
forced them to sell their family
members when they couldn't pay up.

I can't believe that they're
experimenting on kids too.

Damn these people.

How do I know this? Because the
chief was so happy after counting
the gold he had siphoned off of
families that he just had to tell me
about it. Can you believe that? I'm
seriously thinking of defecting to
another country, because there is
no way I want to work here.

I can't escape though. The armed
guards are always watching. They
call it the biohazard containment
protocol, and it's so strict that
not even an ant could get out from
here. I'd have to overpower the
guards somehow or punch a hole in
the wall in order to get out...







        -------------------

The subjects are referred to by
numbers, held in single cells (which
they call "Suites"), and are kept
under constant surveillance. They're
prisoners, guilty of nothing except
for the sin of falling for a scam.

I told that to a co-worker of mine,
and he said that it's their fault
for falling for it. He seriously
said that.

To top it off, they just stuck
inspection duty on me. Saying that
I could go chat with them if I
liked them so much.

Damn these people.
        -------------------

So I sucked it up and did the
inspection rounds. The subjects
cussed at me the moment they saw me.
I didn't do anything to them, but I
guess I'm the enemy from their
perspective. So much for chatting
with them, huh. While heading back,
I heard someone sobbing in the cell
at the end of the corridor and what
sounded like someone else trying to
console the person who was crying.
I did hear something about a pair
of siblings - brother and sister to
be exact - having their cells next
to each other.



It's heartbreaking, but I can't
possibly tell anyone or do anything
about that. I'm such a coward.

Damn myself.















        -------------------

You have got to be kidding me. They
are trying to control human-meshera
homunculi here! I mean, it
technically IS bacteria, but it's
completely different from what the
reports we're sending to the
military say!

They tried to research meshera once
but the plug got pulled on it. The
fact that they're doing it in secret
now must mean they're be looking to
find results important enough to
make the military shut up.

There's probably more to this. I'm
going to keep looking.

        -------------------

Seems like they plan on controlling
the meshera with altered nerve
fibres. They expose the body to
meshera and allow it to transform,
then use it like a puppet when it's
done.

The bacteria assumes motor control
and attempts to move the body when
it invades the nerves, and they
prevent that with drugs and surgical
intervention. They have already
completed the surgery on every
subject here.

This works in theory, but what if
the subjects go out of control
after the procedure is done? Turns
out the subjects get culled with gas
after the procedure. They're going
to use this on soldiers only after
they get the technique right.

Damn it. This is unforgivable.














        -------------------

Everybody is running around with
their hair on fire today. I heard
the big shots from the military's
HQ are inspecting this place in the
afternoon. They must be really
desperate to hide everything,
because even a newcomer like me got
roped in to help cover up. And
thanks to that, I now know just how
far they went in their research.
Damn this place to hell. The stuff
they do here is so sickening that I
feel like throwing up. This research
is off the deep end.

I've memorized the documents I saw
today.

        -------------------

The person who came to inspect
turned out to be a subordinate of
the Crimson Hero. The Crimson of
Zanan is quite famous as a military
man, but in the research circles he's
famous for his mistrust of biological
weapons. He's the very same person
who cut my insect research budget
down to nothing.

Anyway. This is my chance to make
this hellhole disappear! I scribbled
down everything I knew about this
place on to a piece of paper and
managed to slip it to the inspector
as he was leaving.


Guess this is what they call
whistleblowing. This is all I can
do. I've been cooped up in this
place ever since I got here. Time to
pray that they don't find out I was
the one to report it, and that they
get here before the subjects get
sacrificed...












        -------------------

This is bad. The chief must feel
that something is wrong with
upcoming inspection, because he
pushed the experiment forward. Damn,
they're already calling me, telling
me to get ready to start the
experiment. I have to do something!











        -------------------

I couldn't do anything. Didn't have
time to do anything. Could only
follow orders. After the subjects'
meshera was activated, we
administered the drugs.

The drugs were unfortunately not
potent enough to turn people into
vegetables, and all of them started
writhing in pain. Or it could have
been due to the meshera. I don't
know.

All the other researchers looked at
the writhing subjects expectantly.
It's probably not my place to say
this because I'm a weapons
researcher, but their indifference
pisses me off.

Damn these people. Damn them all.

















        -------------------

Two hours after the experiment began,
the changes began to show. Some of
subjects' bodies began to change
colour while others grew tentacles.
The chief called them "low-
compatibility trash". Well guess
what, you're the ones who are trash.
While all other subjects were
convulsing, Subject #14 just keeled
over and stopped moving. His body
remained unchanged so they assumed
he was compatible, but something
seemed off to me. He was wheeled
off into another room for further
examination. Alright, I gotta go too.



        -------------------

The moment we carried him into
another room, Subject #14 leapt up.
Seems like he was just playing dead.
Oldest trick in the book, but it
sure was effective.

With his superhuman strength, he
tossed the guards away as if they
were rag dolls, and his wound healed
instantaneously.

Could he be strong enough to force
his way out of this compound? I
shouted at the guards and told
them to guard the door, pointing
at the exit.

It seemed like #14 understood,
because he made a beeline towards
the exit while mowing down the guards
on his way out. Alright.

















        -------------------

Damn it, I'm an idiot! He could've
cleaned out the entire complex by
himself if he was that strong!

#14 had evaded his pursuers, but the
security alarm has been set off.
Rescuing #16 - his sister - is going
to be a lot more difficult now.

Why did I not thing of this? Damn
it, I'm such an idiot!







        -------------------

People disgust me. I'm sick and
tired of everything.

It's been 12 hours since the
experiment. Some people including
myself were sent off to look to see
if there were any other compatible
subjects.

My head was filled with thoughts of
how I was going to escape from the
quarantine facility if there was
another compatible subject there.
Before I knew it, I had already
arrived at the suites, and I was not
prepared for what I saw there.


The subjects' bodies had transformed
into cocoons. The other researchers
were shouting something. That this
was too fast and that they shouldn't
be transforming in a mere 12 hours.

They frantically tried to contact
those outside on the comms, but then
there was a loud noise. It was the
sound of the containment barriers
closing around the quarantine
facility. The researcher standing
right at the back of the group ran
to try to get out, but the walls
were already down.

The comms was silent.



        -------------------

While we despaired, the cocoons
started assaulting us with
tentacles. We managed to retreat all
the way to the containment wall
though pretty much everyone had
sustained serious injuries. We are
trapped here. There is no way out.

We heard a loud noise deep in the
facility. Was it another subject on
a rampage, striking the walls? I was
curious, but with the tentacles
trapping us here, there was no way I
would ever be able to make it there
to find out.

Some of the researchers have lost
their minds and are laughing, and
the others have barricaded
themselves in a corner. Me? I'm
writing this.

















        -------------------

Damn it, they're gassing us all

Mission Briefing
	prepared by:
	Second Lieutenant Gornock, Yerles Army

In today's exercise, you adventurers
will be mobilized along with my
platoon. You will follow my orders.

See this? This is the command flag.
I will be using this to give
Directives to each and everyone of
you.

Directives are simple, and there
are only three of them.

First off is "Onslaught". It means
search and destroy. When I give
this order, everyone of you should
keep moving while searching for
enemies. Destroy every enemy that
you come across. Be on the offensive
and pursue your targets. Use
everything you got, and leave no
enemy standing. 

Next is "Defense". Do not attack.
Under no circumstances will any of
you engage the enemy when this
Directive is given. Watch for enemy
movements, and sabotage or distract
the enemy when you can, but hold
your fire. If you are under fire,
hold your position the best you can,
and wait for further orders.

Lastly, we have "Intercept". Engage
only enemies that are close by. Any
skirmishes must be within range of
the commander. If I don't see the
enemy, neither do you. Is that clear?
Do not over-extend. Conserve your
resources and wait for new orders.
Do not pursue any enemy out of range.

You have not been trained, so the
instructions you will receive are
simple and few. You will receive
further orders on the field. That is
all.

又是这一阶段？
	written by 自称被选中的人

  各位之中有看过那玩意的人么，那到底叫啥
啊。在人的脚底下闪光的东西。我叫它「斗志」
  
  我啊自己也觉得看到那个很苦恼呢。只要看
到就觉得介意，那东西在战斗中，气力会达到极
限，另一方面，也可以被小心的抑制住。
　
  到极限了就会闪着白色的光。那时候就可以
吧自己所有的力量倾注出去，发挥出极限性能
的一击。简单来说……就是很强力的追加攻击的
预兆。
  
  或许是我的错觉吧。但是感好像还有一个阶
段。超越了临界点的斗志会放着淡绿色的光。
能够让你在战斗中一瞬间支配时间的流动。
  
  有一天你们也会达到这个阶段吧。但是。

Get on my level
	by The Chosen One(?)

Just how many - or how few - of you
can Perceive it? The Aura that glows
at people's feet. This Aura is what
I call...

The Gauge.

Being so Special in my Ability to
Perceive it has long tormented me.
But it is actually not very
difficult to Perceive, for all you
need to do is to... look. When
Emotions run high in combat, watch.
Watch as the Aura grows and reaches
its Peak. The converse is also true -
by reining in the Emotions, the
Gauge can be suppressed.

At its Peak, the Gauge will gleam
with a pearlescent radiance. By
pouring your very Soul into your
Techniques and focusing every Fibre
of your Being, you can Manifest your
Will into The One Strike That Will
Fell The Enemy.

...Which is to say that you can
pull off an extra-strong attack when
it's white.

But that is not all there is to it, 
for the White Gauge is not the final 
stage. Beyond it is the Pale Green 
Gauge, which will allow the User to 
have control over Time itself.



You will eventually understand what 
I mean. That is, if you ever get on 
my level. And I shall be there
waiting.

死灵术说明书
	written by 无聊的死灵法师

　最近已经受够了玩棋了。
  总觉得就么把降灵术这种过去的遗物之类的
东西，大胆的放在手里读的人。我给你这样的
人传授初级的死灵术的话，还是挺有趣的。
  
  最初在棺材里加入适当的残骸，以魔力结晶
为核心，利用棺材来培养尸体残骸从而构成死
灵们的临时的躯壳。要诀就是要体会这里面隐
藏的恶意。
  炼金术已经足以作为操作大量乱七八糟的尸
体技术的代用品了。
  
  作为真正艺术与性感的死灵术的完全的知识，
需要经验的积累。「零件」的严格筛选对于新
手还早100年呢。专用的纳米机械还有黏菌，现
在估计哪里都得不到了吧。
  
  制作出来的不死者的种类，因为残害的质地而
不同，如果拿不好的残骸，勉强的做出形体的话
也会因强度不足而自我崩坏。
   
   一度完成的不死者的棺材，可以加入其他的
残骸来强化，根据种类，也会有不同的强化效果
尽量的试一试吧。
　
   毕竟是没有进行自我意志移植的不死者，脑
袋并不聪明，连袭击人类也要你指挥才行。当然
如果能好好利用的话，你也能获得不错的经验。

  用来奴役的死尸们。请在事前就准备好，看
着对手被这些打到了也会不断扑上来的死尸包
围的绝望吧。

  当然，作为法师的自己也会因此被削弱恢复
和强化的行动。如果碰到一骑当千的对手的话
可能一下就完蛋了。
  这个时候就最好让它们去进行自爆特攻。看
着被污秽的爆炸火花削弱的强者们，实在是相
当愉快的事情。

 ……差不多就这样吧？好了，你也快试试吧死
灵术！

Necromanual
	written by
	a bored necromancer

Chess has gotten boring.

Necromancy is also quickly becoming 
a forgotten art - and that will
not do - so perhaps I could teach
you, dear reader, a thing or two 
about it.

To start, place a piece of a monster 
into a coffin. Next, using a mana 
crystal, shape the body into the 
desired form with Alchemy. Finally, 
garnish generously with malice.

That's all there is, really, if all 
that you want is an army of mass-
produced undead. To make a true 
work of art, however, will require 
you to have a sophisticated taste, 
complete knowledge of necromancy, 
and years of experience. Choosing 
the perfect monster part to use is 
certainly not a task for beginners. 
The special nanomachines and 
bacteria you need are also rather 
hard to come by these days.

Just keep in mind that you can't 
make something big if you start 
from a low quality piece monster 
part. Stretching will only get you 
that far before it starts to 
collapse on itself.



Undead that you've made can be 
remodeled by the further addition 
of one monster part. How it's 
remodeled depends on what kind of 
part is added, so you may want to 
experiment with that. Don't worry, 
you can always remodel with a 
different part if it's not to your 
liking.

These undead don't have the 
capacity to think, and will tend to 
stand around until they receive 
explicit instructions from you. Be 
sure to tell them which humans they 
should be attacking. If they do 
defeat something, you can have good 
experience and a good time without 
even lifting a finger.

There is power in numbers. Create 
enough of them and you can 
immediately replace any that fall 
in combat. Results in an 
unrelenting horde that will 
mercilessly crush your enemies.

You could heal them at the cost 
of your own life, but that's 
probably not a good idea when 
you're up against something that 
single-handedly can take on your 
army of undead. In these cases, 
you might want to blow up them up 
instead. Watch adversaries get 
tossed about like a rag doll, 
explosion after explosion. Costly, 
yes, but you cannot put a price 
tag on fun.

That's about it. Now go try it 
for yourself. Shoo.

日志的秘密
	written by 真之记者

　现在每家一册的必需品就是自动日志：
日志。你知道它的机能是怎么用的么？

　日志会自动记录接受的委托和工作，同时
推测它们的难度。 
  这里写的○等级相当，是说讨伐对象的级别
并不是冒险者自己的等级，所以自己的等级
并不一定需要那么高。
　准备齐全，等级大概在记录上显示的六成
左右，你应该就可以完成那个任务了，有的
任务完全不需要战斗。
　 
　另外，日志持有人的行动一部分自动会被
记录。这些设定的表示与否可以在记录表示
的项目里进行确认和变更。

  其他的在情报的链接里看同业者新闻，确认
现在的各种指标与排名。
  不知道该做什么的时候，就再看一下这个吧。

The secrets of the journal
	by a PRO journalist

I see you've gotten your hands on 
the latest fad that everybody's 
gotta have - the Autoscribing 
Journal. But have you been putting 
it to good use?

The journal doesn't just list the 
quests undertaken by you - it also 
has the difficulty of each one of 
them.

The level (Lv) indicated is that 
of the target monster's, buuuut 
you probably don't have to be 
of that level to defeat it. If 
you're armed to the teeth, you 
could manage with, eh, maybe 60% 
of the monster's level? Not all 
quests involve combat, so there's 
that too.

The journal also automagically 
keeps track of the number of times 
the holder has done something. 
Turn on Record in the Settings, 
and you'll be good to go.

It's also got an uplink to town 
informers, so you can also check 
up on what your colleagues are 
doing while on the go. Oh, and 
it also has your guild quotas and 
rankings.




So yeah, have a look at it when you 
forget where you're supposed to go 
or if you wanna see how you've been 
doing.

魔术讲义发布资料
	written by 艾沃达纳中央学院初等部

・玛娜
　是世界中普遍存在的原始的力量之源。海
中也好，大气中也罢，大地之中都是存在的。
各种生物也会在身体内积蓄玛娜的力量通过
捕食对方来让玛娜移动。这就是魔力的连锁。
只是，生物所持有的玛娜是有上限的，多余
的会被释放出体外。
  完全死掉之后，虽然尸体会留下少量的
玛娜，但大部分会回归世界。
  
  因为主要是用于魔力转换，魔法师间经常
把玛娜P魔力这样有微妙区别的词汇通用。
　
・魔力
  为了方便魔术使用而把玛娜变换了形式的
能源。玛娜直接使用的话作为魔术能源效率
很低。所以很少有人直接按原始的方法去用。
  魔术的素养，就被称呼为魔力，这种比较
新的称呼在最近100年间广泛流传。

・ＭＰ
  魔法数值。魔力（能源方面）的量的具体
数值。

・神力
  神使用能力的必要能源。从贡品中抽取的信
仰心和玛娜的化合物。和魔力是似是而非的东
西。我国魔法师并不能再现。
　
  玛娜是水的话，魔力就是水管里的饮用水
（有水压）ＭＰ是水量，神力就是柠檬汽水
的感觉来记忆就好了。

SOR110 Introduction to Sorcery
	Lecture 1 notes
	Eulderna Metropolitan University

Mana
=====
A primordial source of power 
omnipresent in the world, found in 
the ocean, in the atmosphere, and 
within the earth. Living organisms 
sequester mana, and it may also get 
passed between organisms through 
predation and other means. This is 
known as the mana cycle. Mana 
sequestered within an organism may 
not exceed its capacity for it; 
any excess is excreted to the 
environment.


Dead organisms do not retain mana. 
Upon death, mana previously 
contained within the organism will 
begin diffusing out and back into 
the environment.

As the main use of mana is to 
convert it to MP, many sorcerers 
use the terms MP and mana 
interchangeably.

Magic
======
A form of energy that mana is 
converted into that is required 
for performing sorcery. Without 
conversion, mana cannot be 
efficiently used for spells and 
can only be used for the most 
rudimentary of purposes.

The affinity of an entity for 
magic is also happens to be called 
Magic (sometimes also known as the 
Magic attribute) but this 
terminology is fairly new and came 
into popular use only about 100 
years ago.

MP
===
Magic points. Unit of measurement 
for amount of Magic energy.

Divine power
=============
Energy that gods require to use 
their powers. The current theory 
is that it is extracted from 
offerings of their faithful and 
combined with mana. It is similar 
in some ways to magic, but is 
otherwise a completely different 
form of energy. Sorcerers in our 
country have yet to discover how 
to harness this power.

As an analogy, if mana were water, 
then MP would be bottles of water, 
and divine power would be bottles 
of soda.

采掘好啊
	written by 凿岩机先生

  我是博鲁代伊！我自己来讲我就是个把采掘
发挥到极致的人。

　 开采很好哦。锻炼耐久力同时也能找到了
物品。挖掘前进突破墙壁！自己的道路，要
自己开拓！

  对了。知道开采中从墙壁出来的道具根据
地点不同吗？

  洞窟的话会有矿石，能确保大地神和治愈
女神的贡品！原石加工也能卖好价钱！
  深林的墙壁是食物的宝库，高价的黄金橡果
四叶草之类都可能找到。  
  
  塔楼・岩寨型的则可以获得石材，可以进行
雕刻，不过我对艺术一窍不通！有可能找到别
人藏着的金库呢。
  还有……城市的墙壁里，藏着村民的钱啊，金
块都会出来,放在衣橱里容易被偷，所以现在都
流行放在墙壁里了。
　
  好了，你也快挖，挖啊挖啊，比我挖的更深
更强！成为这样吧！

You dig mining?
	by Borzoi J. Hammer
	
Borzoi here. And when it comes to 
mining, I'm the BEST.

You dig mining? 'cuz I sure do. 
It trains constitution. You come 
across stuff. And best of all, if 
you got no path, you can just 
MAKE ONE.

And didja know that mining in 
different places will get you 
different stuff? Betcha didn't.

These cave nefia are filled with 
ores, so you'll want to go to these 
places if you want to give stuff to 
the Gods of the Earth or Healin'. 
Or if that's not your thing, you 
could give 'em a little polish and 
they'll fetch some good coin.

Forest nefia are full of food that 
you won't find anywhere else. 
Acorns never rot so you can keep 
some in your pockets at all times. 
Then there's valuable golden acorns 
too. Gold! Must've been hidden 
there by a squirrel or summat. You 
might even luck out and find a rare 
four leafed clover.

Fortress and Tower nefia are made 
of stone, so guess what you get 
when you mine there? Stone! Heard 
you can sculpt these with uh... 
"item fusion", but I don't 
understand these artsy kinda 
things. You'll also find safes 
that people hid in there a long 
time ago.

Lesee... oh right. Towns. Mine 
there and you might come across 
the coins and gold bars that the 
folk have stashed away. After all, 
you can't store money in shelves, 
'cuz those would get stolen, 
shelves and everything. So walls 
are where them people hide them 
life savings.

So what are you waiting for? 
Start mining!

呃娱乐项目？
	written by 无名的旅行艺人

  艺人招募委托的达成方法每个人不同
整理好的结果，不要忘记。
  不仅仅是一次，对方也很满意钱好几
次都要披露新诀窍…有人这说了。但是
速度不够！

○演奏：演奏选择的乐器。会场虽然有乐器
，但由于配备在范围上很不方便，携带一些
比较好。用哪种乐器客人的满意度也不同。
高兴的话钱和物品都会给你。
并且，幻之乐器钉头史特拉第瓦里能把
演奏的质量提高…。

○合奏：与同伴合唱，同伴也会得到经验。
不需要乐器。同伴的帮助会使得演奏比普通
状态更容易成功，技能一定程度以上的话，
旋律波动的质量也会上升。但是需要的时间
就多，速度不快就很难赚钱得到高评价分。

○传教：神的美好，通过热情而灵巧的话语来
演讲。也能让同伴获得经验的样子。满足的
话，就能拿到布施的钱。异教徒都能顺利皈依
，看上去比较容易能得到满足。

○魅惑之舞：比演奏更短时间，简单的满足
观众，来赚取点数的技巧。有魅力的话就容易
成功，但是大家都看傻了的话，就拿不到什么
了。
 
○喷火杂耍：燃烧起来了。被烫伤，明明努力
了，却没有人表扬我…。
  一流的艺人能给大家带来满足的笑容，但是
失败的话，就要被丢石头。已经不想被当傻瓜
了。
  最近妈妈也回老家去了……

What's in a performance?
	by a nameless travelling performer

I'm going to jot down a couple of 
ways of completing Performing 
quests in here just so that I don't 
forget. I've heard people say that 
all you need to do is to keep 
performing to a person until he's 
satisfied or bored, but I'm just 
not Speedy enough for that. So.

PERFORMING: perform with an 
instrument of your choice. You 
might find one at the event grounds, 
but it might not be in the right 
place so it's best to bring one 
yourself. What instrument you use 
may determine whether patrons are 
satisfied with your Performance or 
not. If they are, they'll will 
shower you with gold and items. 
I've also heard fables of the 
legendary Stradivarius improving
the quality of items thrown at 
you...

ENSEMBLE: sing with your pets. 
It'll be good experience for them, 
and you don't need an instrument 
either. It's a group effort so it's 
easier to succeed than a regular 
solo Performance, and if you're 
skilled enough the items thrown 
will be of better quality too. But 
doing this takes quite a bit of 
time and stamina, so be sure not 
to waste an ensemble on a deserted 
area. It also means you won't score 
as many Points with the client if 
you're not quick enough.

PREACHING: spread the Word about 
your God and captivate people with 
a gilded tongue. Pets seem to gain 
experience from this. If people are 
satisfied with your preaching, 
they'll give you quite a fair amount 
of alms. Meaning gold. No items 
though. If you're so convincing 
that people convert to your faith, 
then those people are going to be 
even more satisfied.

FASCINATION DANCE: this one's 
quicker than Performing and 
satisfies people more easily, so 
it's great for scoring Points with 
the client. If you're Charismatic, 
then all the better. There's just 
a bit of a problem with this - 
people become too transfixed on
your gyrating hips to give you 
any money.

FIRE BREATHING: did the best I 
could while on fire, but nobody 
even bat an eye...

It's my dream to become a great 
performer and bring smiles to 
people's faces wherever I go, but 
so far it's only been bringing 
rocks. Thrown in my direction. And 
Mum's been telling me to come 
home...

次元间力观测实验报告书
	written by 开发主任『加伯拉』

  次元间力是人或物超越次元的作用力。自古
以来就被人注意到了。但没有具体的观测成功
例，一直被当作架空的学说对待。

   为了确认「因次元之壁阻碍了次元间力，
所以用机器很难观测到」这个假说，这次使用
了次元歪曲装置来除去次元境界面的影响。共
进行了两次实验。
这次使用的机器记录在附加资料的表1中。










  从附加资料图1到图6来看，普通情况下次元
间力只发挥了０．００２５％的效率。
特别是从第二实验，这与次元歪曲率成反比来
看，这和阿丽安的能量定理相符。
相同的存在之间的联系可以超越次元这一点也
并不是夸张。
  但是实验对象A与B移动至同一次元后，次元
间力就立即消失了。
关于这个现象还需要进一步的实验。

  关于能否利用这股能量，次元间的能量也是
从高能量流向低能量，所以只要连结次元便可
以获得无尽的能量。
  但是，次元间力的谜还有很多，长期榨取能
量对两个次元的影响也无法预测。就算没有任
何影响，也有被对方视为侵略行为的可能。

  首先，我建议要了解多次元宇宙同一存在之
间的联系是怎样的。通过研究这个机制，这样
我们就可以将次元间通信实用化。
