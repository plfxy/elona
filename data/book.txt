给迷路士兵的指南书
	written by 艾沃达纳的将军
（注）非艾沃达纳士兵不得阅读！

　迷路的诸位士兵们、茫然于该如何行动的
诸位士兵们，你们不需要任何担心。和队伍
走散的时候该如何行动，就由我来作个简单
的说明吧。

■该如何行动

　首先从战场上逃离，向着东南的煤矿城镇
韦尔尼斯前进即可。镇里有食物供给，如果
攒了一笔小钱的话也可以购买其他的物资。

　做了适当的准备之后，即可朝着镇东附近
的洞窟出发。那里对于想积累经验的新兵来
说是最合适的地方，也能稍微赚到一些钱。

■不该采取的行动

　不要轻率地到处乱闯。新手不小心闯进陌
生的迷宫后，立刻被恐怖的危险生物杀掉的
事情时有发生。

　要一直留意食物的储备量。食物很贵，但
对于生存是必须的。虽然除了买取以外还有
不少获得食物的方式，但随时注意肚子的饥
饿程度仍是必须的。

■最终的目的是？

　积累了足够的经验的话，就以莱希墨苏洞
穴为目标吧。那是奈菲亚的遗迹群之一，据
说其中隐藏着能将我等艾沃达纳人引向繁荣
的重大秘密。

　至今为止仍没有人能到达洞穴最下层并活
着归来。谁能解开这个迷宫的秘密，就会获
得巨额的赏金。

最后祝诸君马到成功！

Beginner's Guide
	Author: An Old Adventurer

<This book is weathered and yellow
with age>
	
I leave this book here in the off
chance that should I not survive my
final adventure, others may learn
from my trials and tribulations.

I have lived many years and have
done many deeds. I have seen much
what this world has to offer.

This cave has been my hideaway in the
last few seasons, though if you are
reading this, it is most likely now
yours to reside in. I don't mind as
I'm either dead or fabulously rich.

Still, if you are planning on going
into the same trade as I and are not
the local scamps just playing at it,
some advice should be parted to you.

Now where to begin?

I won't know from which way you came
from so it's best to give you the 
local landmarks;

If you follow the trail from here to
the South-East you find Vernis. It's
a mining town, but it should still
have some shops, a tavern and an inn.
You should be able to find some work
there, as well as food, gear, and 
even a friend or two. The innslady I
recall was having some trouble with
local ruffians the last time I was
there. 

East of Vernis is what the locals 
call the "Puppy Cave". It's well...
always changing. A local mage called
it a "Hausdorff-Besicovitch fractal
plane", whatever that means. 
If you leave the cave and come back, 
or go up or down floors, it will
change all the creatures, items, 
walls, and exits. You can find quite 
a bit of stuff if you don't mind 
hopping in and out. 

The "Puppy" of this cave is fairly
deep in, and a child in town would
love to get it back, but it kept
getting itself killed when I tried.
It always reappeared on that floor 
when I left and came back, but I 
gave up after a few tries. Maybe
you can do it. Just don't get lost.

Once you are a bit tougher and better
geared, the Gray cave of Lesimas
might be be another good spot. It's
one of the more ancient ruins of
Nefia, and there's bound to be
something interesting in there. If
you ignore the roads, it's almost due
south of this cave.

No doubt all around the land there
will be caves and forests spawning
with loathsome critters. Just don't
go blindly into them, check them out
BEFORE going in. Preparation is a key
difference from a live Adventurer and
a dead one. 
         -== Geography ==-
If you follow the roads from Vernis:
-Port Kapul is to the west. 3-5 days
  Good Business there as it's a port
  Fighters Guild and an Arena
  
-Palmia is to the East. 2-3 days
  Big City, lots to see and do
  King lives here
  Has Arena
  
-Yowyn is to the South-East. 2-3 days
  Farm Town, not a lot to do unless
  you like turnips and Harvesting.
  Note to self: Clean out Yeek's Nest
  AGAIN... worse than rabbits they be
  
-Lumiest is South-East of Palmia
  On an Island
  Lots of mages live there
  
-Derphy is South-west of Vernis
  No roads lead there
  Wretched hive of scum and villainy
  Steer clear of Dragon's Nest!

-Noyel is Far FAR to the east
  Bring a sandwich, it's a long walk
  Snow is slow going
  Don't poke the Fire Giant. Bad juju
  
      -== Work and Jobs ==-
While you may want to go about
slaying dragons and saving damsels,
it's best to start small. Being an
adventurer means you'll do jobs that
no one else wants to do.

Deliveries are a good way to start
out in this business. Example:
     Accept job
  -->GET THE ITEM AT YOUR FEET!<--
     Deliver item to recipient
     Collect reward
Note that forgetting the item to 
deliver is very BAD, but not the end 
of the world. If you are very lucky,
the local shops or fields may have
what you are looking for. They won't
know the difference, trust me. 
Also note how many days you have to
deliver things. Running from Lumiest
to Port Kapul is NOT fun, and you may
simply not be fast enough yet to do
the really high paying ones. 

Hunting can range from easy to very
VERY hard. The money offered is a 
good way to tell how bad it will be.
Be careful doing these, as it takes
just one nasty critter to get you.

Gift getting also ranges from easy
to absurd. Just remember that if you
accept the job, running from town to
home and back takes time, and you may
not have that long to do it.

Cooking requests are only good if you
can cook, have the items, and can
deliver before the food rots. But if
you check out the local bakery before
accepting, you may just be able to
buy what you need before doing the
job.

Harvesting LOOKS easy, but it can be 
very hard. Waste no time, and go as
unburdened as possible. Speed is the
key for these jobs.
Finally, try not to fail a job, it's
a black stain on your record, and too
many of those can get the guards on
you. Use you noggin BEFORE accepting
any job. Can I do it? Will I have the
time? Who gets their kid garbage on
their birthday?

      -== Advice and Tips ==-
And now a few nuggets of wisdom:

-Cargos of food are cheap, and you'll
eat them as you travel overland. But
you cannot eat them inside towns or
dungeons. If you are hungry just exit
the town or dungeon, eat, and enter.

-Be cheap. 'b'ash fruit bearing trees
in towns and fields for fruit, and 
scavenge whatever plantlife you can
outside. That armor is not going to
come to you if you keep eating cakes
and pies. 

-The meat of many monsters is edible.
Women love Putit flesh for what it 
does for their skin. Some isn't so
good for you, but if you're hungry...

-While succulent and tasting of young
pork, the flesh of man should not be
eaten. Only crazy people eat people,
and you aren't crazy are you?

-Innkeepers for coin can feed you
quite nicely. They have beds too.

-Until you can buy/find/steal a bed
for your home, stay at inns when you
are tired. A sleeping bag is a good
idea for deep dungeon trekking.

-Should a pet or ally fall in battle,
most towns have a bartender who can
bring them back for a price.

-Check your 'j'ournal! It has all the
information about quests you are on,
jobs you are doing, events, your own
reputation and bills. Check it often.

-On the subject of bills. When you
become famous enough, you'll get a
salary of money and items twice a
month. The salary will be dropped off
in the chest in your home. However,
with salary also comes taxes. Take 
the bill in hand and cash in pocket 
to the local embassy just north of 
Palmia and pay it there. Don't let 
your bills add up as the taxmen are 
worse than any dragon or demon.

-Should your skills start to plateau,
seek a trainer. There is one in every
town, and will sharpen your existing
skills. They also have skills you do
not yet possess and for a price will
teach you them. Beware though, they
only accept platinum coins, and those
are in short supply these days.

-And finally, beware the weather. Oh,
a little rain may have never killed
anybody, but with heavy rain comes 
lightning that can blind you and the
great thunder which can confuse you.
Try not to get lost while in one.
Sometimes, the best thing to do is
stay in place till your head clears.
Rarely, but with increasing fervor is
the dreaded Etherwind. Beware this.
A friend of mine was stuck outside in
it and could barely be called human
when he finally staggered inside.
When it comes, FIND SHELTER! I cannot
stress this enough. Hide in a cave if
the monsters inside won't tear you to
bits. If you are in a town you are by
no means safe. Run to the innkeeper
and demand Shelter. Wait out the evil
storms, and only after it passes can
you return to your duties.







In closing, I hope this is of some
use to you, and I hope my final
adventure is a good one. Now if you
will excuse me, I have a fort to
conquer. How bad could it be?

Good luck to you and your travels.

博物馆经营指南
	written by 标本狂

　对经营博物馆很好奇？给想经营博物馆的
你几条建议。

　博物馆，是通过向来客展示稀有的标本和
卡片来赚取收入的设施。不管在博物馆里的
哪都可以，只要把上述物品摆放出来应该就
可以确认到博物馆当前的排名了。

　每只标本或卡片都有着各自不同的稀有度
。越是巨大的标本、越是难以获得的独特卡
片，就越有其稀有价值。

　需要注意的是，重叠在一起的物品将无法
被展出。并且，种类完全相同的道具的稀有
价值，将从第二个开始降低。

那么，请努力经营吧。我期待着你的博物馆
成为人们的话题传到我耳中的那天哦。

ps. 喔喔、差一点就忘了。初建时的博物馆
很狭窄，觉得地方不够用的时候，就挖开墙
壁来扩建吧。

Museum Administration Manual Mk.III
Written by Curator Schmidt

So you want to run a Museum do you?

Young Sir/Lady, it takes some hefty
capital to purchase such a deed, but
if you have the time, patience, and
money this old curator will help you
out with this handy, unbiased manual.

In your wanton and overly hedonistic
destruction of the local flora and 
fauna (henceforth known in this guide
as "adventuring") you might have come
across some of the following:

Item a.) Figure of <Fauna>
Item b.) Card   of <Fauna>

If so, then you may have barely given
them a glance before shoving them in
your sack if ill-gotten gains and 
simply gone back to "adventuring".
No doubt you have sold them for more
tankards of ale and legs of mutton,
but the more intelligent among you
might collect them into a pile and 
ponder "Why do monsters have these?"

The answer: Vanity! And Magic!

And it is these things that we shall
profit from. And it's so simple even
an adventurer can do it!

Still, just in case, I have written 
down the exact steps to minimize any
unfortunate mishaps that might arise.

Step 1.) Purchase a deed of a Museum.
   This step is what chokes out the
   small fry from the serious doers.
   
Step 2.) 'r'ecite the deed upon the
   spot on the world you wish your
   museum to be. Let the gnomes do
   the building, it won't take long.

Step 3.) Aesthetically place all the 
   Cards and Figures you have found
   inside the museum. Neatness is a
   virtue, though not necessary.

Step 4.) Profit!

That should do it as far as the basic
setup requires. If you want even more
information about specific queries, 
merely read on to learn more!
      -== Notes and Caveats ==-

Whilst having more than one museum is
certainly possible, only your first
one will make any money. 

Figures are worth more than cards
most times anyway.

Don't pile multiple items upon one
space. It is entirely unprofessional,
and utterly ineffectual.

The mightier the monster, the better
value the card and Figure. Rare are
the Figures with a Name or Title on 
them. These so-called "Unique" 
Figures indeed are best. And in 
order to encourage more museums to 
showcase these, I've set up a trust 
that will reward museums based on the
number of Unique Figures that they
have on display, paid out on the 
first of every month.

Back on the topic, while having a 
dragon's card is nice, having ten 
is just tacky. Variety is key. 
The more duplicates you have,
the less they are worth.

Oh and one more thing... the gnomes
that build your museum have somewhat,
oh, narrow tastes. you may have to 
bring in a <house board> or 
<register> to sculpt it into your 
own grandiose vision.



            -== Errata ==-

Base cost: 		140,000 gp
Maintenance cost:    1500 gp/month
Income per rank:      100 gp/month

**Figures above are approximates only


Happy Curating!

Crimberry Addiction and You	
A Schmidt Education Pamphlet

Every year more and more people are
becoming addicted to the seemingly
harmless Crimberry.

Known by an ancient Nefian dialect as
Kur-amu-beri, which should just go to
show its long and sordid history with
our land and peoples, the Crimberry 
is a strong hallucinogen with many
different applications.

Simply eating a berry can cause the
following symptoms in 15 to 60mins:
- Hallucinations
- Impairment like Drunkenness
- Raving like a loon
- Fever-like motor-control failure.
Crimberries are highly addictive, and
should the addict fail to get his
next "Crim", he will either turn to
other narcotics, or become a threat
to our community.

And of course, no one thinks of the
poor children who get involved in our
seemingly "adult" activities. They've
even created a new way to "enjoy" the
devilish berries; 

They copy the wild yeeks and dry them
then shove the dried berry up their
nose. This "snorting" of Crimberries
will lead to the proliferation of 
excess aggression, and will lead more
desparate individuals to become known
as "adventurers" commiting insane
deeds to get their next fix.
While some of the older, long haired
Wizards demand that Crimberries remin
legalized, if only for their sacred
"rituals", this must stop!

        FOR OUR CHILDREN!
        
        FOR OUR FUTURE!

Blessed Herbs
Chronicled by Dr. Schmidt, PhDM

* Curaria [KYURARIA AQUIFOLIUM]
Effect is well known and medicinal.
However, the ability of said effects
is based entirely on it's so called
"consecrated" state, which has been 
clinically proven to be a real effect
and not merely a placebo.
Effect: All-around enhancement

* Morgia [MOJIA DIPSACUS PILOSUS]
Massive hormone Stimulant. Increases 
muscle mass, strength and endurance.
Blind-Test subjects received various
"consecrated" state herbs and thusly
received differing returns. This only
goes to prove that Gods do in fact
exist, and that all our science is 

meaningless in their might.
Effect: Strength and Endurance
	enhancement

* Mareilon [MAREIRON DIPSACUS FEROX]
Neuro-Chemical stimulant. Increases
cognitive abilities. Level of effect
entirely on "consecrated" state.
Effect: Mental enhancement

* Spenseweed [SUPENSUUIDO LONGIFOLIA]
All effects as of yet are unknown,
though it has been noted that those
who ingest it seem to be more "aware"
and levels of perception may be up.
More testing is needed to determine
all side effects.
Effect: Perception enhancement 


* Alraunia [ARURONIA MARTYNIA LUTEA]
Hormone-activated. Aphrodisiac. 
Thus extremely popular with the 
locals. Oddly enough, it also appears
to have some ability at improving 
memory. Research still pending grant.
Effect: Memory and Libido
	enhancement

* Stomafilla [SUTOMAFIRIA HYPOGAEA]
Upon contact with the stomach, the
herb expands and fills the cavity,
leading the consumer to feel very 
"bloated". Long term use and the 
nutritional level of the plant has
yet to be verified. There are also
reports of it enhancing the user's
speed, but most sporting competitions
have yet to ban its use.


Effect: Satiety inducer, Speed
	enhancement


As more specimens are brought in and
tested, so shall we update this brief
guide.

Until then,

商店经营指南
	written by 熟练的店长

　店的运作没有你想象中的那么困难。先把
商品陈列好，再雇个有魅力的店长，然后就
可以坐等定期的销售报告了。写长篇大论实
在太麻烦了，所以就只写几条提示好了。

* 来客的人数与店主的魅力、以及店面的等
级成正比。

* 即使是同样的商品，也会根据店主的交涉
技能来改变卖出金额。店主的交涉技能与魅
力的潜在能力可以用青铜币恢复。

* 当销售的商品的数量达到一定程度后，店
面的等级就会上升。

* 店面的等级越高，来客就会带着越鼓的钱
包来消费。

* 因此，店面等级低的时候，高价的道具是
无法卖出去的。

* 家具和货车里的货物不能拿来卖。

* 如果某天卖出了商品，店主的业绩就会增
加。积攒业绩的话，店主可以获得2个专长。

* 根据销售额和来客人数积累雅卡点数。点
数可以通过卡片来使用。

　最后提醒一下，落到商店地面上的物品是
会被自动当成商品的，千万不要因此而丢失
了重要的物品。
   不想卖的东西，为了让其他人知道是展示
用的，可以通过装修用隔离绳区分开，或者
用陈列柜盖上。在地砖一览中的第10和11
行可以找到。

Shop Owning and Operational manual
Rewritten by Schmidt the Fence

So, you think you can own a shop? I
know, sitting on your arse all day
hawking wares seems easy enough. 

But then riddle me this genius:
If it's so easy, why is there only 
one shop per type in every town?

The answer is simple: 
      Only the strong Survive!
(Well, that and the high taxes...)

Store operation is so difficult, 
only the meanest and cut-throat can
survive in town. You however, have 
an advantage over us town-shops:
     You will be outside!
And while that sounds less than ideal
right now, your monthly payments to
the crown are cut down to a mere
Five Thousand Gold Pieces a Month
(5000gp/Month)
Which is peanuts to what us city
shops have to pay, believe you me.

     -== Setting up a Shop ==-
Step 1.) Buy a deed of a shop.
 (A Mere 200,000gp at a base price.)

Step 2.) 'r'ead the deed aloud on the
spot of the world you would like it
to be built on.

Step 3.) Set up the shop (see below)

Step 4.) Caveat Emptor!

     -== Running your Shop ==-
Your shop is up and now it must be
run, which is a separate process.

First you need a shopkeeper. Now this
cannot be you, as you have to out and
get the things to sell. So you have
to go and get one of your companions
to do it. You should choose a worker
based on how good they look, and how
good a negotiator they are, as they
are the vital two things in any good
sale. 

Now that you have such a goon,
go to the register in the shop.
Assign that person to the job. 

The other part is also simple, to 
SELL Stuff you need to HAVE stuff.
So go get stuff and and leave it in
your shop.




-== Little Golden Nuggets of Info ==-

Your Salesperson stays at the shop
and cannot come with you.

Selling stuff makes money(natch) 
and also raises shop rank.

A higher shop rank brings in
customers with a fatter wallet
ready for you to empty. The pricier
items also won't sell until your
shop is of a higher rank.


The number of customers that will
stop by the shop also depends on
the shop's rank and the 
shopkeeper's Charisma.

How much a customer is willing to
cough up for an item depends on the
shopkeep's Negotiation skill.

The potentials of the shopkeeper's
Negotiation skill and Charisma stat 
can be topped up by spending bronze 
coins at the register.

Investigate your allies to find the
prettiest and bestest negotiator.
It used to cost an arm and a leg, 
but these days it's a mere 100gp.
You young 'uns are lucky.

On days that the shop sells
something, the shopkeeper will earn
experience, which can go towards 
acquiring up to two special 
shopkeeper feats.

That's not all! Rack up yaca points
based on how much you sell and how
many customers visit. Spend them
points by using the yaca point card,
which every shop should come with
thanks to the agreement with the
Temple of Yacatect.

Due to a vicious spat with the 
local Furniture Union, we cannot 
sell any spare furniture out of 
town. We in town can still buy and
sell it. The same goes for cargo. 
Whatever goes in your cart, 
doesn't go in the shop.

Anything else, garbage, junk, even
rotten stuff can be sold if you can 
find a sucker for it. If it's on
the floor, it'll be fair game to 
the customers.

So if there's some item in the
shop that you don't want customers
to go layin' their paws on, you'll 
want to mark it off as a display
item with a rope divider or glass 
case tile. Those you can find when
redesigning the shop. They're
probably somewhere in the 9th and 
10th rows in the list from the top.

Due to your shop permit, you can
ONLY sell a maximum of 10 items at
a time. You can expand on this for
a mere 2000gp for an additional 
ten slots, and every subsequent
1000gp for each 10 slots after.

	-== Fiscal Information ==-
Base cost:            200,000 gp
Maintenance cost:     5,000 gp/month
Income per rank:      ??? gp/month**

**Why ??? for income? 'Cause that's 
where you come in bub!

With luck, you too will be living
large like me!

Remember: The GP stops here!

Good Business to you!

过的，地点的话当然是选在农田里了。在下
雨的日子里播种的种子不容易枯萎，而农田
的土地会增加收获果实时留下种芽的概率。

　成功地完成了播种之后，就关注着种子的
成长吧。顺利的话，种子会在土中生出根来
经过半个月到一个月的时间后结出果实。栽
培技术低的时候，经常会发生种子在成长中
途干枯的情况，这时候请不要灰心。

　最后就是翘首以盼的收获了。嗯…先把这
点记住吧：已经结出果实的种子是不会枯萎
的。

　收获是最考验栽培能力的时候，如果你的
技巧相当高，说不定收获后植物会留下新芽。

　如果把有机物放在堆肥里，过几天就会变
成肥料。因为使用肥料会使植物瞬间成长，
枯萎的风险也会减少。

　田地里也放有作物管理套装。用这个管理
的话，只会对特定的植物有利，所以能收获
的产物会被固定。各种劳动都能培育出什么
就由你来亲眼确认吧。

栽培能力越高收获的蔬菜或者水果的品质就
越高。不过相应的，会引来以上等作物为目
标的野生动物。击退一次的话暂时就不会再
过来了…。

在北提里斯有很多奇妙的植物种子。有机会
的话请务必买来种在自己的田里，开始享受
起自给自足的新生活吧。

ps  也有雨天更适合进行收获的传闻。实际
上有没有效果完全是个谜。搞不好只是当事
人的心理作用。

Easy Gardnin'
by Valentina Schmidt

Thinkin' bout growin' yer own food?
Whether yer jist lookin' ta fool 
around with a bit o' herbs or ta 
raise some serious garden stuff 
like I have all my life, ya got the 
right book.

First, ya got ta pick a time an'
place ta plant some seeds. Seeds
are best planted when it's raining
an' on field tiles. Seeds planted 
during rain are gonna wilt less 
often, and those planted on
a field that's found on farms an'
those abandoned ranches will leave 
a new seedling behind more often
after harvest.
Once ya've planted some seeds, it's 
time ta watch em grow. If yer lucky 
an' all goes well, the seed will 
sprout an' grow over the course of 
along half a month ta a month an' 
bear fruit. If yer jist starting 
off an' don't got none of a 
Gardnin' Skill much - then ya'll 
find near all of yer crops wilting 
afore harvest, but don't give up.

Lastly is what I expect is 
ev'rybody's favorite part. 
Harvestin'. But first, know that 
any plant that has fruited ain't 
gonna wilt ever until ya harvest 
it. An' what ya harvest will change 
with the season. Meanin' the same 
plant from the same seed is gonna 
give different things next season.

Harvestin' is where yer skill 
matters the most. If ya got 
a-plenty of it, ya'll find the crop 
leavin' behind a seedlin' after 
harvest more often.

Leave organic stuff on a compost 
fer a few days ta turn it inta 
fertilizer. Use that on yer crops 
an' they'll be done growed up in no 
time at all - aye, an' I really 
mean no time. There won't even be 
time fer em ta wilt.

Ya'll find the crop management tools
on the farm. Use it ta make only
certain types of plants grow, which
will ensure ya harvest only certain
types of items. Try it out yerself
ta see which treatment results in
what crops.

As yer Gardnin' skill increases, 
the quality of fruits an' vegetables
ya harvest will increase. An' that 
also means heapin' gangs of dad-
blasted wild animals are gonna come 
a-visitin' like yeeks to Yowyn, so 
be careful that ya don't git eat 
up. Git em once an' they won't come 
back fer a while though.

There's all sortsa crazy seeds an' 
crops ta be found an' growed in 
Norf Tyris. Good luck with your 
farm, and happy tillin'!



P.S. I've heared tell that ya should
also harvest on a rainy day. Does 
it actually have any effect? My
Pappy said his Pappy's Uncah 
sweared up and down that it does, 
but dogged if I know.

You Water Wasting Jackals! Curse you!
By Schmidt the Water Bandit

Where I come from water is life! 
Waterholes are protected to the death
down to the last woman and child!

I come to this country, and what do I
see? Water, nay, LIFE, being wasted!
You people, who live in such lushes,
waste so much it's sinful!

Water should be blessed, given to all
your gods as tribute! Do you people
even know all the things you can do
with dirty water? 

I suspect not.

Nor will you if you simply toss it 
all away like dung from a diseased
camel.

May all who waste water wither like

对畜牧的建议
	written by 畜牧大师

　嗯…其实我不擅长写书的…不过想赚些版
费…而且也闲得没事干…

　说起畜牧……我最早继承家业的时候也曾有
过浪漫的梦想，但现实只是接连不断的给我
这个新手带来教训。首先。不得不跨越的第
一道难关是要想办法得到畜种。畜种是啥…？
顾名思义，就是能不断产下新的幼仔的生物
把生物登陆为畜种之后，这个物种就会随着
时间推移逐渐变得兴旺起来。

　刚开始的时候，推荐养鸡啊羊啊之类的野
声动物。野生动物的繁殖能力基本上都很强
怪兽的话，越强的生物，繁殖成功的概率似
乎就越低。

　虽然家畜只要进行放牧，它就会自由的生
活，但喂食家畜饲料的话就可以把它养肥。
也可以通过使用收款机来撒饲料，不过效果
比直接喂一袋要差，所以根据目的来选择如
何喂食吧。

　还有，如果想要获得健康的肉质最好用家
畜用的大型刷子来定期的为它刷洗，温柔的
抚摸这类的养殖技巧也是必要的。

　具有特性的家畜有时也会增加。具有什么
样的特性，要在刷洗的时候通过触诊来判断
就会明白。根据作为种畜的家畜的状态不同
能够发挥出的特性遗传给后代的也不同。
　刚产下的家畜很小，所以喂给它奶让它长
大吧。越成长的家畜的肉与奶的质量越好。

　尽量让牧场中保持整洁。因为产蛋和榨取
乳汁是需要用到一定空间的…粪便是家畜得
病的根源，要认真处理哦。如果家畜生病了
就只会排便，还会让其他家畜感染。预防与
治疗疾病最好的还是消毒，不能准备消毒的
话就要考虑隔离和处理掉了。

　还有，家畜如过实在太多的话，也是会让
产蛋产乳率下降的。20匹左右差不多是恰当
的数量吧？适当地弃掉一些幼仔也是可以的。

　家畜增加之后能用来做什么呢，随你喜欢
了…因为家畜随时都可以带出来，卖给奴隶商
人也可以哦。越顺从越友好的家畜就越是价值
珍贵，所以要认真交流。
　活祭献给神也不错，家畜自古以来就是很受
神明欢迎的供品。与尸体不同的是评价与重量
无关，而是友好关系和肉质。
　如果杀掉家畜剥掉肉与皮的话可以卖出一个
相当客观的价钱。即使你不会做饭，也可以把
它放到晾晒石上，就可以做成保质期超长的肉
干，你也就不会为食物烦恼了。

　宰杀家畜的时候，偶尔会让其他家畜变得
躁动不安，这种时候只要离开牧场一次再回
来，一切就都会平复下来了。

　说明大概就是这么多了吧…反正畜牧也不
会花太多的工夫，你也考虑一下把畜牧当
成副业吧？

A Ranching guide for the Greenhorns
	3rd Edition
	By Cattle Baron Schmidt

Howdy all! I write this guide for 
the same reason I rustle cattle 
about: Money. Plenty of good 
royalties to be had if one takes 
the time to put pen to paper. 
Still, while I can't give ALL my 
secrets to you as it'd put me out 
of business, but I can't get you to
by my next book if I don't give at
least the basics.

To begin with, you'll at least 
eighty thousand or so to purchase a
deed to a ranch. Less, if you are a
good talker or rather attractive.

Then, with deed in hand, find the 
best place for it you can find.
While it cannot be within town 
limits, as you do NOT want people 
asking nosy questions on what 
exactly it is you are breeding, or
other such moral or ethical-type 
dilemmas.

Once you are at the spot of choice,
merely 'r'ead the deed and claim 
your land.

-== The Joys & Perils of Breeding ==-

Good Breeding is a fine art, and is
what separates us from the savages.
No where more true is this rule 
than at a ranch.

Any animal assigned to be a "breeder"
will stay on the ranch, and, in time,
produce milk, eggs, shit, and other 
bits. And no, I am not going to try 
to explain how mammals will lay eggs 
or how exactly you milk a twenty-ton
firebreathing lizard. I don't rightly
try to answer those sort of questions
and frankly, neither should you. Just
accept the fact and move on.

Now, those items can be sold for fair
coin, but the real profit is in the
breeding and rightly so. This isn't a
farm after all. Now, with the coming 
of the Etherwind, breeding has become
a very simple process. Not like the
old days, when you had to keep track
of bloodlines, and breeding seasons,
and listen to the mating howls, and
the awful thumping of not one but two
Twenty-ton Carnivores going at it.
All. Night. Long.

But I digress. Now all you do is just
assign it breeding duties, and let it
be. Soon, there will be more of them.
Mitosis? Magic? Again these are the
questions you should not rightly ask.

Generally speaking, wild animals -
chickens, sheep, rabbits and the like
- breed like rabbits. Heh. Another
thing to keep in mind is that the
more powerful a monster is, the
slower it'll breed on your ranch.
That's something to remember when
choosing what to breed if you need a
gazillion more of them.

I did say that all you have to do to
get them to breed is to leave them
to their own devices. So feeding them 
is optional - I dunno they probably
eat sunlight or something - but if 
you do give them a livestock feed 
it'll fatten them up. Or you can use 
that register on the ranch to split 
that feed amongst every animal there.
Won't fill them up as much, but gets 
the job done.

If you want to get really good 
quality meat, what you have to do is 
brush them once in a while. Grab a 
big brush, and give them a nice 
rubbing. Of course, you need to know 
how to do the Rub special 'a'ction 
in order for you to do that.

Sometimes you'll manage to breed
one of them farm animals that are
really good at something. I don't
mean maths or anything. They might
be good at putting out oodles and
oodles of milk or eggs. Or maybe
they'll have good meat or skin.
You'll know what they're good or bad
at by paying attention during
brushing. Those qualities will be
exhibited while they're on the
ranch. If they're the breeder, 
they'll produce more animals with 
similar qualities.

Newborns on the ranch will start out
small, so 'T'hrow some milk their way
to make sure they grow up big and
strong. If you do, the meat and milk 
they give will improve.
You'll want to keep the ranch clean.
Ranch animals need space to lay eggs 
and uh... milk themselves. Can't do 
that if there's shit all over the
place, can they?

Leaving their shit around will cause
them to get sick and crap even more. 
It'll also make the other animals 
on the ranch sick. Disinfecting the 
ranch will both prevent that from 
happening AND heal the sick animals. 
But if you can't afford that, then 
you might wanna quarantine or 
cull them.

It's a good idea to keep an eye on
the number of animals on the ranch.
They don't breed as fast and also
produce less milk and eggs when
the ranch is full of animals. I find
20 animals optimal number. See if
you can't find a nice balance for
your ranches too.

    -== Fruits of Your Labour ==-

Now, these... offspring, can be used
in several ways, which I shall list
below:

'i'nteract with it and get it to join
you on your travels.

Gene Engineering with zero risk to 
the originals.

Profit by taking it to a slave 
trader if, I might add, you know 
where to go where no one asks any 
questions. They fetch more if they 
are tame - so you might want to make 
sure they're servile and have a 
decent bond with you.

Or you can kill it and the odds of 
a carcass being salvageable are 
much better than duking it out in 
the wild.

Sacrifice it alive to your God - a 
favourite of the Gods since time
immemorial. Unlike offering pieces 
of a corpse on an altar, weight 
won't matter here. Instead, it's 
apparently scored based on the its 
bond with you and the quality of 
its meat.


As a side note, sometimes the ranch
animals get a little antsy when one 
of them is killed. Just pop out of 
the ranch and come back, and you'll 
find that they have settled down.

-== The Drydock. Waste Nothing ==-

A benefit of having a ranch is having
a drydock at your disposal. Now I put
mine in the southeast corner so the 
wind will blow the stench away from
my estate. I assume it will be the 
same for you (you'd best hope so).
In any other trade a rotten carcass
would be nothing but a loss.




Not so with a ranch, where nothing 
goes to waste. Simply dump your 
rotten meat into the drydock to 
cure, and in no time at all you'll 
have delicious, lightweight, 
adventurer-sought-after Jerky!

	-== In Conclusion ==-

At this point a wise man would stop
writing here, and just let you dream.
Simply imagine the possibilities, and
then grasp them.

In my next book, which will be soon
available, I will highlight the more
subtle tricks to the trade, like how
exactly you prevent a twenty-ton, 
fire-breathing, living force of
Destruction and Death from simply
leaving the ranch after setting all
to the flame and devouring you on the
spot for asking it to sit there and
breed.

Until then Partners!

You have been cordially invited hero,

You have gotten a bit of a name for

for you. And sensibly, I won't take
that risk later. But I do so love a

So hear this.

Of course you should have a reason

How about treasure? Ah, I knew that

much treasure if you can find it. It

Wily Mujaf's Thesis
	by <Caim>

I saw the town get turned into a 
smouldering pile of rubble. I was
hoping for just one more chance.
Fact is, I didn't get it. Because
over and over again she fought lions,
refusing to die. Look, her rib cage's
still intact and everything. Didn't
eat into it at all. Good as new.
Crazy stuff, if you ask me. Now, you
receive four options. First is 
especially attractive and will not
try to kill you. Next up, stunning...
character to go with her looks. Third
has a habit of lazing around. Lastly,
a loyal mage who will go walk over
red-hot embers for you. I wish I were
anywhere but here. Actually, I
CAN run away. RIGHT NOW. Alright,
time to haul butt. You guys aren't
ever taking me alive. I'm gonna keep
running. Over and out.
















10 thousand gp. More than enough to
wash away everything. I want to
forget these memories that are still
raw. Seems like it was just the
other day when it happened. But as
much I would like to forget, I can't.
Could I have stopped everything that
happened? She's never coming back
anyway. I would have gone insane
over the sight of people bleeding,
scratching their faces off. Flecks of
skin flying. It was quite the
headache for everyone in town, from
royalty to the peasants. Now

奈菲亚综合症
	written by 泽纳恩精神医生

奈菲亚综合症，就是一种在奈菲亚内出现的
精神疾病。

・症状
　大概有三个阶段，越后的阶段越是严重。


阶段１
　判断力降低。
　其降低会有个体差异、经常有无视迷宫内
有益道具，变得会经常冲入敌阵中央，但是
不会影响到城镇内的生活。这个阶段的多为
活跃着的冒险者。

阶段２
　认知力降低，变得无法客观的看待事物。
有很多人变得不能认知到楼梯，因此困在迷
宫里回不了家。

阶段３
　攻击性增强。
　在这个阶段会变得积极地向同族或同伴攻
击。
　原理不明，相同阶段3的人基本不会自相残
杀。虽然发病者有时会形成群体，但互相看
起来并不认识。
　本身攻击性极低的人在这个阶段看起来没
有变化。


　阶段2的患者会一直在奈菲亚内徘徊，有时
地壳变动后会与奈菲亚一起沉入地底。不过
也有不少逃出迷宫的人。

・大致原因
　有人说原因是奈菲亚的魔力，有人说是地
磁力，哪种看起来似乎都有可能，但缺乏证
据。
　长久呆在奈菲亚内会引起症状恶化，但个
体差异十分明显。
　特别是被称为冒险者的人们即使得病了大
多也都处于阶段1。根本就没得病的也有不
少。
　与其这么说，不如说只有不会症状恶化的
个体才能作为冒险者活动更为正确。

・对策
　现在并没有治疗方法。
　但有研究数据表明，具有耐性体质的人在
同伴中的话，其他人也很难得病。
　另外，也有失去统帅的部队集体得病的案
例，因此可以认为精神状态会有很大的影响。
　也有发病后离开奈菲亚症状改善的案例。

・大众认知
　从古代开始人们就认为奈菲亚很危险，但
不是基于奈菲亚综合症的判断。
　很多人误认为清理了奈菲亚内怪物就没有
什么危险，过于自信地杀进去结果发病的人
从古至今都是源源不断的。（＊１）。
　一些国家禁止国民踏足奈菲亚，也会让军
队做一些处理，但还远远不够。













＊１　
　最早的记录是三千年前在库加雷托发现的
文献上记载的，一位在奈菲亚内变得奇怪了
的英雄被人们恐惧地称作「迷宫附体」，最
后被处死了。

A Review on Nefian Psychosis
	by a Zanan Psychologist

Nefian Psychosis is a mental disorder
that develops in some people when
they are within a Nefia (commonly
known as a dungeon).

       -=Signs and symptoms=-
The disorder presents itself in three
stages, each of which are described
below, with the latter stages being
more serious.

       -=Stage 1 psychosis=-
Characterized by lowered cognitive
ability. The decrease in cognitive
ability varies between patients, but
they will typically be lacking in
their object recognition ability and
ignore useful items on the ground or
charge blindly into enemies.

Nevertheless, many adventurers are
able to maintain a high quality of
life in towns while afflicted with
this stage of the disorder.

       -=Stage 2 psychosis=-
Extremely low object recognition
ability, with a complete inability
to recognize some classes of objects.
Many afflicted by this stage of the
disorder are unable to recognize
staircases, and experience great
difficulty in finding their way home.




       -=Stage 3 psychosis=-
Marked by increased aggressiveness.
At this stage, patients actively
target and exhibit aggression towards
other people, including acquaintances
and former allies. For reasons yet
unknown, Stage 3 patients do not
attack one another.

Some of the afflicted band together
to form working groups, so it appears
that they are somehow able to
recognize one another. It has also
been observed that individuals who
displayed no aggressive behaviour
before the onset of the disorder do
not display any aggression whatsoever
even at this stage.

Many individuals suffering from Stage
2 psychosis may get trapped in
dungeons, but there are many reports
of such individuals suddenly
reappearing aboveground when the
dungeon sinks into the crust.

          -=Hypothesis=-
Two hypotheses have offered to
explain this phenomenon, namely that
it results either from exposure to
mana in dungeons or to a particular
type of magnetic field. Neither of
these explanations, however, have
proved to be completely satisfactory.
Though is indeed a strong and
positive correlation between the
amount of time spent in dungeons and
the severity of psychosis, it does
not account for the high variability
in the speed and severity of onset of
psychosis between individuals.

Many afflicted adventurers also never
progress beyond Stage 1, and many
more never develop psychosis at all.
It is possible that individuals who
become adventurers are inherently less
likely to be predisposed to the
disorder.

 -=Prevention of Nefian Psychosis=-
There is no cure for Nefian Psychosis
at the time of writing. However,
research has shown that recruiting
allies who are not predisposed to
psychosis can offer some protection
against the disorder. There has also
been a case where an entire group of
individuals developed the disorder
after losing their commander, so it
is commonly thought that mood and
the mental state of individuals
play an important part in both
the progression and prevention of
the disorder.

Some individuals also experience an
improvement in their condition after
avoiding dungeons for a period of
time.

       -=Public perception=-
The notion that dungeons are
dangerous is well-entrenched in
society since ancient times, but few
will associate Nefian Psychosis
with that danger. It is a common
misconception that dungeons are
innocuous without the monsters that
reside within them, as there have
been many documented cases of
skilled dungeon-delvers coming down
with the disorder since ancient
times (see footnote 1).
 
For that reason, some countries
forbid entrance to dungeons while
others limit dungeon access to
the military, but these measures
still fall short of preventing
cases of Nefian Psychosis.









Footnote 1:
The earliest record of such a case
was an inscription discovered in
Kjaraht, dating back to 3000 years
ago. A well-known dungeon conquerer
became deranged and it was suspected
that he was possessed by a dungeon,
leading to his eventual execution.

送礼的礼仪
	written by 旅行商人

　你把物品交给对方时，是怎么做的呢？
有没有过觉得放下去太麻烦了就直接交给别
人了呢？
  
　如果对方是很亲密的人，或者很急的时候
那就没办法了，也有很多年长者很介意被直
接递交。
　
	在大部分地区，不把礼品放到对方脚下的
话都是很无礼的行为。当然，家人的话不这
么做也是可以的。
　
	送礼时要留意，艾索里亚大陆的一些地区
，放在脚下反而是无礼的，在这里被不认识
的人用手递交了物品，也不能生气。

　不同地方有不同的礼仪，旅行之前请好好
确认当地礼仪吧。

Gifting Gifts
	by a Travelling Merchant

What is it that you do when you would
like to give someone a gift? Do you
sometimes get lazy and give it to
them by hand instead of placing it
at their feet?

If it's for someone close like a Soul
Mate, or if you are in a terrible
hurry, then that's fair enough.
However, many of the elderly find it
rather offensive to be handed items.

It is polite to place items at
peoples' feet in most areas. Of
course, you don't have to go that far
for your family members.

One thing you should keep in mind is
that it is rude to place items at
peoples' feet in parts of the
Asserian continent. When visiting
these areas, you must not get angry
when strangers pass items to you by
hand.

Like they say, when in Palmia, do as
the Palmians do. Remember, always
read up on the culture before
visiting a place!

a tag team.

Now grab a buddy. The one on the left
will be in charge of movement.

If you're fighting a battle in a tag
team, watch how your partner moves.
If you're fighting someone strong,
pay special attention to how you move
during the fight, and I guarantee
you'll learn lots from it.

When taking fire, whoever has the
most health at that moment should
take damage for the other. And don't
forget! Split any gold you pick up
with your partner.

Walk at the same speed to make sure
you don't trip. You there, you don't

Adventurers Quarterly (Spring 518)
	by Edelia the maid, age 12

Hello there. I am Edelia the maid.
How do you do? Today I bring to you
advice that will hopefully prove to be
of use in your adventures.

There are many types of furniture
that are indispensable to every
home. No home should be without beds,
cooking utensils, and storage
containers.

Some furniture like bookshelves can
be used as a (t)ool. Yet others -
fridges for example - are storage
containers that can be (o)pened.
These will prove useful in keeping
your home clutter-free.

Before buying a new deed and moving
house for a change of pace, how about
looking over your house and seeing
if you can't sort things out?

充满怨恨的笔记本
	written by 泽纳恩研究员

　今天，被所长叫过去，还以为有什么事， 
原来是去别研究所的转属命令
　现在的工作是昆虫兵器的研究。虽说只是
下层人员，身为这里担当者的我不在的话会
人手不足的。而且听说转属地是做利用菌强
化人体的研究。
总觉得很危险啊…。
　虽然我坚决拒否，但那已是决定了的事情
我的想法就被那样轻视。打心底不可原谅。
---------------------------------------

　新的研究所里，都是比之前那些更加疯狂
的家伙。我还想究竟是从哪里收集到这些实
验体的，没想到居然是从那些用欺诈行为使
之破产的家庭那里强行买来的。
仔细看被验者中连小孩子都有。
打心底不可原谅。
　用欺诈集来的钱做预算多了一大把，那所
长很开心的说着。这什么职场啊！一想到在
这种地方工作…真是流亡他国的心情都有。
　但是全副武装的守卫都擦亮了眼睛，可能
是戒备着发生生化危机，连一只蚂蚁出去的
缝隙都不留。看来不打倒守卫，或破坏墙壁
就没法逃出去了…。
---------------------------------------

　被验者们被关在名为个室的独房里，被用
号码称呼，监视着。这简直是是囚犯啊。明
明只是受到欺诈什么事都没做错啊，我向前
辈们说过之后，得到了被骗的家伙才有错的
这种胡话。
　结果，既然你同情那就去和它们一起愉快
聊天吧，就这样我强行变成了今晚检查被验
者的值班了。打心底不可原谅。
---------------------------------------

　我勉强着去检查，发现了我的被验者们一
个个都对我破口大骂。虽然我对他们什么都
没做，但从他们来看我也是敌人吧。什么叫
一起愉快聊天啊。
　回去时，在走廊深处传来了哭泣以及安慰
它的声音。说来有对兄妹是被相邻收容起来
了。
　虽是紧揪胸口的思想，但我还是怕回去对
话后，被他们责怪。
…我，对这样的自己打心底不可原谅。
---------------------------------------

　怎么会这样，在这里研究的居然是魔蝎拉
的人体控制！虽然确实是菌没错，但这和军
方提出的资料不一样啊。
　好像是打算做魔蝎拉的研究却被制止过，
即使如此现在还在背后秘密的进行研究，就
是说，打算弄出莫大的成果让军方哑口无言
吧。
　感觉还会出什么问题。还是先看看吧。
---------------------------------------

　还想着到底如何控制魔蝎拉，看来是以神
经系统的强化为主。对肉体的变化毫不出手
干涉，还反过来直接利用那点。
　因细菌侵蚀神经后身体会擅自动起来，这
貌似是通过人体改造和药物投用来进行控制。
现阶段可以说，全员都是已经过改造手术的
了。
　理论上是可行的，但在成功之时被验者岂
不是会不听我们话暴动起来呢？
刚想了下，实际利用这个技术的应该是士兵。
被验者充其量只是弃子一旦确保技术就会被
当做垃圾处理了吧。打心底不可原谅。
---------------------------------------

　今天所内都手忙脚乱。中午突然从军方本
部有人来视察了。
看来是非常急忙焦虑，连让新人的我都帮忙
做些隐蔽的工作了。我知道了那些过程。令
人作呕般打心底不可原谅的黑色问题不停的
涌出。
我一边进行作业，让那些谨记于头脑。
---------------------------------------

　来视察的，据说是那位红之英雄的部下，
说到红之英雄一般会认为那是一位有名的军
人，但在研究员之间却是因为总是怀疑生化
兵器的实用性而出名。曾经我也因为昆虫兵
器的预算被其消减而有过痛苦的回忆。
　不管什么都好，这可是能捣毁这腐败研究
所的机会啊！我急忙把所有的问题点都写下，
成功把它交给了正在回去的视察官。总算是
赶上了。
　这就是所谓的内部告发吧。自从来到这里
就一直是与世隔离无法和外部取得联系的状
态，也只有这样做了。
　接下来就只有祈祷别让人发现是我告发的，
和在被验者中出现牺牲之前能了结此事了…。
---------------------------------------

　糟了。所长看来对这次的视察感到了焦虑
加速实验把它提前了。
　可恶，前辈们在喊快去做实验的准备。
就没有什么办法吗!



---------------------------------------

　…结果，我没有时间做任何事，只能按照
指示做着准备。
　全被验者的魔蝎拉都活性化后，向他们投
下了药物。如果是没有经过改造的人类一下
子就会变成废人了，看来这烈药可不是虚有
其表，马上全员都开始痛苦了。虽然也可能
是魔蝎拉的作用。
　除我之外的研究员全部，都用期待的眼神
看着痛苦不堪的被验者们。虽然着手兵器开
发的我没有资格谈论人道，但总觉得莫名火
大。打心底不可原谅。
---------------------------------------

　实验开始经过2小时后，出现了变化。
有的体色出现了变化，有的长出了触手。他
们用所长的说法貌似是「适配率低的渣屑」。
人渣是你才对。
　在其他的被验者痛苦之时，只有14号倒地
不起一动不动。身体没有出现任何变异被认
为是适合体，总觉得有些奇怪。收到指令，
为了调查所以要把他搬到别室。
　真没办法，稍微去下吧。
---------------------------------------

　我们在把他搬出隔离区域的瞬间，14号一
跃而起！看来那是所谓的装死。虽然是老办
法，但在这个状况可以说是效果拔群。
　14号用不可置信的怪力打飞了守卫，就算
受到了攻击也会瞬间再生。
　他的话是不是可以强行正面突破逃出呢？
抱有此想法的我，马上指着出口大叫到。
别让他逃了，加固防守出口。
　看来14号理解了出口的位置，把聚集起来
的守卫一个个打倒出去了。看来一切顺利。
---------------------------------------

　啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊啊！我真是笨蛋！！
那么强的话说不定可以一个人就压制这个研
究所啊！
　14号好像逃过了追兵，但这让研究所的警
备系统大幅强化了。这样下去16号…救他的
妹妹也会很困难吧。
　这哪里是一切顺利，啊。为什么我那时没
有想到这点呢。打心底不可原谅…。
---------------------------------------

　现在，我对人类的丑陋已感到厌倦。


　实验开始已经过了12小时，或许还有其他
适合者于是开始了再次巡逻。我也是其人员
之一。
　边想着如果有适合者该怎么把他带出隔离
区域边来到了独房前，发生了令人惊愕的事。
　被验者们的身体已经开始变异成茧的姿态。
其他的研究员叫喊道。这个形态是预想之外
的，12小时能变异到此程度也是预想之外。
　急急忙忙用无线电向外面的家伙传达了现
在的状况后，响起了很大的声音。以为发生
什么而巡视四周的我们，看到了隔离区的隔
离墙壁降了下来。最末端的研究员急忙跑过
来时，隔离墙壁已经完全降了下来。
　无线电、没有回复。
---------------------------------------

　对绝望的我们，茧毫不留情的伸出触手向
我们来袭。总算是全员都避开致命伤后退到
了隔离墙壁附近，这样下去谁都无法得救。
　从深处，传来了某种冲击音。
是被验者暴走，在敲打墙壁吗？
虽然很在意怎么回事，但我还是没有避开那
些触手潜入深处的勇气。
　我抛下那些开始发狂大笑的家伙，躲在角
落的家伙，写着这文章。

Bitter Last Words
	of a Zanan Researcher

The chief called me in today. Turns
out I'm going to be transferred to
another research facility. Why?
We're so close to perfecting our
weaponized insects! I may be low on
the management hierarchy, but I'm
still the one in charge of my team.
We're not going to have enough
people here if I get transferred.
What's worse is that this facility
I'm going to is conducting research
on bacterial human augmentation.
That term itself gives me the chills.

This is an order so I can't just say
no to it, but it really pisses me
off how they made that decision
without consulting me. And now
they mention it to me in passing
as if it were no big deal.

Damn it.















        -------------------

The people at this new facility are
crazy. And considering where I used
to work, that's saying a lot. I
wondered where they were getting
their subjects from. Turns out they
swindled money from people, then
forced them to sell their family
members when they couldn't pay up.

I can't believe that they're
experimenting on kids too.

Damn these people.

How do I know this? Because the
chief was so happy after counting
the gold he had siphoned off of
families that he just had to tell me
about it. Can you believe that? I'm
seriously thinking of defecting to
another country, because there is
no way I want to work here.

I can't escape though. The armed
guards are always watching. They
call it the biohazard containment
protocol, and it's so strict that
not even an ant could get out from
here. I'd have to overpower the
guards somehow or punch a hole in
the wall in order to get out...







        -------------------

The subjects are referred to by
numbers, held in single cells (which
they call "Suites"), and are kept
under constant surveillance. They're
prisoners, guilty of nothing except
for the sin of falling for a scam.

I told that to a co-worker of mine,
and he said that it's their fault
for falling for it. He seriously
said that.

To top it off, they just stuck
inspection duty on me. Saying that
I could go chat with them if I
liked them so much.

Damn these people.
        -------------------

So I sucked it up and did the
inspection rounds. The subjects
cussed at me the moment they saw me.
I didn't do anything to them, but I
guess I'm the enemy from their
perspective. So much for chatting
with them, huh. While heading back,
I heard someone sobbing in the cell
at the end of the corridor and what
sounded like someone else trying to
console the person who was crying.
I did hear something about a pair
of siblings - brother and sister to
be exact - having their cells next
to each other.



It's heartbreaking, but I can't
possibly tell anyone or do anything
about that. I'm such a coward.

Damn myself.















        -------------------

You have got to be kidding me. They
are trying to control human-meshera
homunculi here! I mean, it
technically IS bacteria, but it's
completely different from what the
reports we're sending to the
military say!

They tried to research meshera once
but the plug got pulled on it. The
fact that they're doing it in secret
now must mean they're be looking to
find results important enough to
make the military shut up.

There's probably more to this. I'm
going to keep looking.

        -------------------

Seems like they plan on controlling
the meshera with altered nerve
fibres. They expose the body to
meshera and allow it to transform,
then use it like a puppet when it's
done.

The bacteria assumes motor control
and attempts to move the body when
it invades the nerves, and they
prevent that with drugs and surgical
intervention. They have already
completed the surgery on every
subject here.

This works in theory, but what if
the subjects go out of control
after the procedure is done? Turns
out the subjects get culled with gas
after the procedure. They're going
to use this on soldiers only after
they get the technique right.

Damn it. This is unforgivable.














        -------------------

Everybody is running around with
their hair on fire today. I heard
the big shots from the military's
HQ are inspecting this place in the
afternoon. They must be really
desperate to hide everything,
because even a newcomer like me got
roped in to help cover up. And
thanks to that, I now know just how
far they went in their research.
Damn this place to hell. The stuff
they do here is so sickening that I
feel like throwing up. This research
is off the deep end.

I've memorized the documents I saw
today.

        -------------------

The person who came to inspect
turned out to be a subordinate of
the Crimson Hero. The Crimson of
Zanan is quite famous as a military
man, but in the research circles he's
famous for his mistrust of biological
weapons. He's the very same person
who cut my insect research budget
down to nothing.

Anyway. This is my chance to make
this hellhole disappear! I scribbled
down everything I knew about this
place on to a piece of paper and
managed to slip it to the inspector
as he was leaving.


Guess this is what they call
whistleblowing. This is all I can
do. I've been cooped up in this
place ever since I got here. Time to
pray that they don't find out I was
the one to report it, and that they
get here before the subjects get
sacrificed...












        -------------------

This is bad. The chief must feel
that something is wrong with
upcoming inspection, because he
pushed the experiment forward. Damn,
they're already calling me, telling
me to get ready to start the
experiment. I have to do something!











        -------------------

I couldn't do anything. Didn't have
time to do anything. Could only
follow orders. After the subjects'
meshera was activated, we
administered the drugs.

The drugs were unfortunately not
potent enough to turn people into
vegetables, and all of them started
writhing in pain. Or it could have
been due to the meshera. I don't
know.

All the other researchers looked at
the writhing subjects expectantly.
It's probably not my place to say
this because I'm a weapons
researcher, but their indifference
pisses me off.

Damn these people. Damn them all.

















        -------------------

Two hours after the experiment began,
the changes began to show. Some of
subjects' bodies began to change
colour while others grew tentacles.
The chief called them "low-
compatibility trash". Well guess
what, you're the ones who are trash.
While all other subjects were
convulsing, Subject #14 just keeled
over and stopped moving. His body
remained unchanged so they assumed
he was compatible, but something
seemed off to me. He was wheeled
off into another room for further
examination. Alright, I gotta go too.



        -------------------

The moment we carried him into
another room, Subject #14 leapt up.
Seems like he was just playing dead.
Oldest trick in the book, but it
sure was effective.

With his superhuman strength, he
tossed the guards away as if they
were rag dolls, and his wound healed
instantaneously.

Could he be strong enough to force
his way out of this compound? I
shouted at the guards and told
them to guard the door, pointing
at the exit.

It seemed like #14 understood,
because he made a beeline towards
the exit while mowing down the guards
on his way out. Alright.

















        -------------------

Damn it, I'm an idiot! He could've
cleaned out the entire complex by
himself if he was that strong!

#14 had evaded his pursuers, but the
security alarm has been set off.
Rescuing #16 - his sister - is going
to be a lot more difficult now.

Why did I not thing of this? Damn
it, I'm such an idiot!







        -------------------

People disgust me. I'm sick and
tired of everything.

It's been 12 hours since the
experiment. Some people including
myself were sent off to look to see
if there were any other compatible
subjects.

My head was filled with thoughts of
how I was going to escape from the
quarantine facility if there was
another compatible subject there.
Before I knew it, I had already
arrived at the suites, and I was not
prepared for what I saw there.


The subjects' bodies had transformed
into cocoons. The other researchers
were shouting something. That this
was too fast and that they shouldn't
be transforming in a mere 12 hours.

They frantically tried to contact
those outside on the comms, but then
there was a loud noise. It was the
sound of the containment barriers
closing around the quarantine
facility. The researcher standing
right at the back of the group ran
to try to get out, but the walls
were already down.

The comms was silent.



        -------------------

While we despaired, the cocoons
started assaulting us with
tentacles. We managed to retreat all
the way to the containment wall
though pretty much everyone had
sustained serious injuries. We are
trapped here. There is no way out.

We heard a loud noise deep in the
facility. Was it another subject on
a rampage, striking the walls? I was
curious, but with the tentacles
trapping us here, there was no way I
would ever be able to make it there
to find out.

Some of the researchers have lost
their minds and are laughing, and
the others have barricaded
themselves in a corner. Me? I'm
writing this.

















        -------------------

Damn it, they're gassing us all

Mission Briefing
	prepared by:
	Second Lieutenant Gornock, Yerles Army

In today's exercise, you adventurers
will be mobilized along with my
platoon. You will follow my orders.

See this? This is the command flag.
I will be using this to give
Directives to each and everyone of
you.

Directives are simple, and there
are only four of them.

First off is "Onslaught". It means
search and destroy. When I give
this order, everyone of you should
keep moving while searching for
enemies. Destroy every enemy that
you come across. Be on the offensive
and pursue your targets. Use
everything you got, and leave no
enemy standing. 

Next is "Defense". Do not attack.
Under no circumstances will any of
you engage the enemy when this
Directive is given. Watch for enemy
movements, and sabotage or distract
the enemy when you can, but hold
your fire. If you are under fire,
hold your position the best you can,
and wait for further orders.

Third is "Intercept". Engage
only enemies that are close by. Any
skirmishes must be within range of
the commander. If I don't see the
enemy, neither do you. Is that clear?
Do not over-extend. Conserve your
resources and wait for new orders.
Do not pursue any enemy out of range.

Lastly, we have "Talking". Do not
attack any enemies, but speak
or sing to them to break their will.
Your aim will be to wear them down
and get them to retreat.

You have not been trained, so the
instructions you will receive are
simple and few. You will receive
further orders on the field. That is
all.

还没有抵达这个阶段吗？
	written by 自称被选中的人

　各位之中有多少人能看到那玩意的呢。在
人脚底下闪耀橙色的灵气。我叫它「斗志」。
  
　我也曾为只有自己才能看到那个而很苦恼
呢。不过只要仔细观察就会注意到，那东西
会在战斗中随着情绪的高涨达到极限。反过
来说，也可以通过控制情绪来抑制。
　
　达到极限后斗志就会闪着白色的光。据说
这时可以使出把所有技术倾注进去、充分发
挥身上所有装备性能的一击。这是意志的体
现…也就是强力追加攻击的预兆。
  
　但不要误会了，这还只是不完美的阶段。
超越了极限的斗志会绽放着淡绿色的光，能
够让你在战斗中一瞬间支配时间的流动。
  
　总有一天你们也会明白的吧，只要你们能
够抵达那个阶段的话。我会在这边耐心地等
着你们的。

Get on my level
	by The Chosen One(?)

Just how many - or how few - of you
can Perceive it? The Aura that glows
at people's feet. This Aura is what
I call...

The Gauge.

Being so Special in my Ability to
Perceive it has long tormented me.
But it is actually not very
difficult to Perceive, for all you
need to do is to... look. When
Emotions run high in combat, watch.
Watch as the Aura grows and reaches
its Peak. The converse is also true -
by reining in the Emotions, the
Gauge can be suppressed.

At its Peak, the Gauge will gleam
with a pearlescent radiance. By
pouring your very Soul into your
Techniques and focusing every Fibre
of your Being, you can Manifest your
Will into The One Strike That Will
Fell The Enemy.

...Which is to say that you can
pull off an extra-strong attack when
it's white.

But that is not all there is to it, 
for the White Gauge is not the final 
stage. Beyond it is the Pale Green 
Gauge, which will allow the User to 
have control over Time itself.



You will eventually understand what 
I mean. That is, if you ever get on 
my level. And I shall be there
waiting.

死灵术说明书
	written by 无聊的死灵法师

　最近下棋已经下腻了。
　就这样让死灵术成为被遗忘的古物也挺不
忍心的，难得你能读到这本书，就把初级的
死灵术传授给你，以此消遣一番吧。

　首先在棺材里加入适当的残骸，以魔力的
结晶为核心，暂时用炼金术来培养尸体残骸
，从而构成死灵们的躯壳。要诀就是要体会
这里面隐藏的恶意。
　如果只是量产可操纵的虾兵蟹将般的尸体
，炼金术已经足以作为代替了。

　想要制作一种真正的极品需要艺术的品味
、完整的死灵术知识、经验的积累、经过严
格筛选的「零件」，这些对于新手还早了
100年呢。专用的纳米机械还有黏菌，现在
估计哪里都得不到了吧。
  
　虽然是能够制作出来的不死者种类，但因
为残骸的品质不好，做不了太大型的不死者
。就算可以勉强做出来形体，也会因强度不
足而自己崩溃。
   
　成功完成的不死者棺材中可以加入其他的
残骸来强化。强化时使用的残骸种类不同，
也会有不同的强化效果，尽量试一试吧。强
化后也可以用其他的残骸替换强化效果。
　
　毕竟是没有进行自我意志移植的不死者，
脑袋并不聪明，所以袭击哪个人类好要由你
指挥。当然如果能好好利用的话，你也能获
得不错的经验。

　使役不死者最重要的是数量。总之事前准
备好大量的不死者，不管是打倒还是被打倒
都可以补上不死者，看着对手被死尸包围的
绝望吧。

　姑且也可以通过消耗施术者的力量来恢复
或强化不死者。不过如果碰到一骑当千的对
手的话可能一下就完蛋了。
　这个时候能派上用场的就是自爆特攻了。
让不死者一块一块地团团围住爆炸吧。虽然
这样消耗会很严重，但看着被污秽的爆炸火
花削弱的强者们，实在是相当愉快的事情。

　…差不多就这样吧？好了，你也快试试死
灵术吧！

Necromanual
	written by
	a bored necromancer

Chess has gotten boring.

Necromancy is also quickly becoming 
a forgotten art - and that will
not do - so perhaps I could teach
you, dear reader, a thing or two 
about it.

To start, place a piece of a monster 
into a coffin. Next, using a mana 
crystal, shape the body into the 
desired form with Alchemy. Finally, 
garnish generously with malice.

That's all there is, really, if all 
that you want is an army of mass-
produced undead. To make a true 
work of art, however, will require 
you to have a sophisticated taste, 
complete knowledge of necromancy, 
and years of experience. Choosing 
the perfect monster part to use is 
certainly not a task for beginners. 
The special nanomachines and 
bacteria you need are also rather 
hard to come by these days.

Just keep in mind that you can't 
make something big if you start 
from a low quality piece monster 
part. Stretching will only get you 
that far before it starts to 
collapse on itself.



Undead that you've made can be 
remodeled by the further addition 
of one monster part. How it's 
remodeled depends on what kind of 
part is added, so you may want to 
experiment with that. Don't worry, 
you can always remodel with a 
different part if it's not to your 
liking.

These undead don't have the 
capacity to think, and will tend to 
stand around until they receive 
explicit instructions from you. Be 
sure to tell them which humans they 
should be attacking. If they do 
defeat something, you can have good 
experience and a good time without 
even lifting a finger.

There is power in numbers. Create 
enough of them and you can 
immediately replace any that fall 
in combat. Results in an 
unrelenting horde that will 
mercilessly crush your enemies.

You could heal them at the cost 
of your own life, but that's 
probably not a good idea when 
you're up against something that 
single-handedly can take on your 
army of undead. In these cases, 
you might want to blow up them up 
instead. Watch adversaries get 
tossed about like a rag doll, 
explosion after explosion. Costly, 
yes, but you cannot put a price 
tag on fun.

That's about it. Now go try it 
for yourself. Shoo.

The secrets of the journal
	by a PRO journalist

I see you've gotten your hands on 
the latest fad that everybody's 
gotta have - the Autoscribing 
Journal. But have you been putting 
it to good use?

The journal doesn't just list the 
quests undertaken by you - it also 
has the difficulty of each one of 
them.

The level (Lv) indicated is that 
of the target monster's, buuuut 
you probably don't have to be 
of that level to defeat it. If 
you're armed to the teeth, you 
could manage with, eh, maybe 60% 
of the monster's level? Not all 
quests involve combat, so there's 
that too.

The journal also automagically 
keeps track of the number of times 
the holder has done something. 
Turn on Record in the Settings, 
and you'll be good to go.

It's also got an uplink to town 
informers, so you can also check 
up on what your colleagues are 
doing while on the go. Oh, and 
it also has your guild quotas and 
rankings.




So yeah, have a look at it when you 
forget where you're supposed to go 
or if you wanna see how you've been 
doing.

魔法讲义阅读资料
	written by 艾沃达纳中央学院初等部

・法力
　是世界中普遍存在的原始的力量之源。海
中也好，大气中也罢，大地之中都是存在的。
各种生物也会在身体内积蓄法力的力量通过
捕食对方来让法力移动。这就是法力的连锁。
只是，生物所持有的法力是有上限的，多余
的会被释放出体外。
　完全死掉之后，虽然尸体会留下少量的法
力，但大部分会回归世界。
  
　因为主要是用于转换成魔力，魔法师间经
常把法力P魔力这样有微妙区别的词汇通用。
　
・魔力
　为了方便魔法使用而把法力变换了形式的
能源。法力直接使用的话作为魔法能源效率
很低。所以很少有人直接按原始的方法去用。
　魔法的素养，就被称呼为魔力，这种比较
新的称呼在最近100年间广泛流传。

・ＭＰ
　魔法数值。魔力（能源方面）的量的具体
数值。

・神力
　神使用能力的必要能源。从贡品中抽取的信
仰心和法力的化合物。和魔力是似是而非的东
西。我国魔法师并不能再现。
　
　法力是水的话，魔力就是水管里的饮用水
（有水压）ＭＰ是水量，神力就是柠檬汽水
，以这样的感觉来记忆就好了。

SOR110 Introduction to Sorcery
	Lecture 1 notes
	Eulderna Metropolitan University

Mana
=====
A primordial source of power 
omnipresent in the world, found in 
the ocean, in the atmosphere, and 
within the earth. Living organisms 
sequester mana, and it may also get 
passed between organisms through 
predation and other means. This is 
known as the mana cycle. Mana 
sequestered within an organism may 
not exceed its capacity for it; 
any excess is excreted to the 
environment.


Dead organisms do not retain mana. 
Upon death, mana previously 
contained within the organism will 
begin diffusing out and back into 
the environment.

As the main use of mana is to 
convert it to MP, many sorcerers 
use the terms MP and mana 
interchangeably.

Magic
======
A form of energy that mana is 
converted into that is required 
for performing sorcery. Without 
conversion, mana cannot be 
efficiently used for spells and 
can only be used for the most 
rudimentary of purposes.

The affinity of an entity for 
magic is also happens to be called 
Magic (sometimes also known as the 
Magic attribute) but this 
terminology is fairly new and came 
into popular use only about 100 
years ago.

MP
===
Magic points. Unit of measurement 
for amount of Magic energy.

Divine power
=============
Energy that gods require to use 
their powers. The current theory 
is that it is extracted from 
offerings of their faithful and 
combined with mana. It is similar 
in some ways to magic, but is 
otherwise a completely different 
form of energy. Sorcerers in our 
country have yet to discover how 
to harness this power.

As an analogy, if mana were water, 
then MP would be bottles of water, 
and divine power would be bottles 
of soda.

采掘好啊
	written by 凿岩机先生

　我是波索尔！虽然是自夸自卖，但我是个
把采掘发挥到了极致的人。

　采掘好啊。锻炼体质的同时也能找到物品
。挖掘前进突破墙壁！自己的道路，要自己
开拓！

　对了。你知道采掘中从墙壁挖出来的道具
会因地点不同而不同吗？

　洞窟・湖型奈菲亚的话会埋有矿石，如果要
确保大地之神和治愈女神的贡品的话一定要去
挖哦！用合成之壶对原石进行加工也能卖个好
价钱！
　森型奈菲亚的墙壁是稀有食物的宝库！不会
腐坏而且轻的橡树果、价格高昂的黄金橡树果
…一定是松鼠之类的将这些埋在墙里的吧。也
许能找到幸运的四叶草哦。
  
　塔・寨型奈菲亚则可以开采出石材。虽然可以
通过合成进行雕刻，不过我对艺术一窍不通！
除此之外还有可能找到别人以前藏着的金库呢。

　巢窟型的墙壁上掩埋着在那里生活的生物的
痕迹与蛋。就算是挖到粪便也不要哭哦。

　陵园型的墙壁本身就是墓碑！挖的话会得到
供品和棺材。报应？那是什么。能吃吗？

　矿山型可以开采到矿物。与一般矿脉能挖到
的矿石是不同的，不过不知道是不是开采光的
才会出现！因为能够挖出不错的黏土，陶艺家
会很开心的！

　还有…城镇的墙壁里，藏着居民的钱和金块。
放在衣柜里的话连衣柜都会被偷掉，所以现在
比起衣柜存款，墙壁存款更加流行。
　
　来吧，你也快挖，挖啊挖啊，像我一样挖得
又深又强！挖吧！

You dig mining?
	by Borzoi J. Hammer
	
Borzoi here. And when it comes to 
mining, I'm the BEST.

You dig mining? 'cuz I sure do. 
It trains constitution. You come 
across stuff. And best of all, if 
you got no path, you can just 
MAKE ONE.

And didja know that mining in 
different places will get you 
different stuff? Betcha didn't.

These Cave and Lake nefia are 
filled with ores, so you'll want 
to go to these places if you want 
to give stuff to the Gods of the 
Earth or Healin'. Or if that's not 
your thing, you could give 'em a 
little polish by tossing them in
a fusion pot and they'll fetch some 
good coin.

Forest nefia are full of food that 
you won't find anywhere else. 
Acorns never rot so you can keep 
some in your pockets at all times. 
Then there's valuable golden acorns 
too. Gold! Must've been hidden 
there by a squirrel or summat. You 
might even luck out and find a rare 
four leafed clover.

Fortress and Tower nefia are made 
of stone, so guess what you get 
when you mine there? Stone! Heard 
you can sculpt these with uh... 
"item fusion", but I don't 
understand these artsy kinda 
things. You'll also find safes 
that people hid in there a long 
time ago.

Nest nefia will have the remains
and eggs of whatever lived in
there. And a whole load of shit,
which you're gonna have to wade
through to find anything good.

People bury their dead in the 
walls of Cemeteries. Prolly just 
out of habit for those people 
used to stashing their stuff in 
walls. Dig around for offerings and 
coffins. Are you gonna get cursed 
for doing that, you ask? Pssh 
'course not. Waste not, want not.

Mines yield ores. But not regular
ores. Probably ran out of those.
Wouldn't have become a nefia if
they didn't, eh? There's lotsa
clay here for pottery and stuff.

Lesee... oh right. Towns. Mine 
there and you might come across 
the coins and gold bars that the 
folk have stashed away. After all, 
you can't store money in shelves, 
'cuz those would get stolen, 
shelves and everything. So walls 
are where them people hide them 
life savings.

So what are you waiting for? 
Start mining!

什么是表演？
	written by 无名的旅行艺人

　个人对于完成招募艺人委托的方法进行了
各种各样的尝试，为了避免忘掉将结果整理
下来。
　有人说要点是在对方满足或厌烦之前不断
地表演。但是我的速度不够快！

○演奏：用你选择的乐器进行演奏。会场中
虽然也有乐器，但因为范围上会不方便，最
好还是自带乐器。使用不同乐器客人的满意
度也不同。作为打赏会送给你钱和道具。而
且，梦幻之乐器斯特拉迪瓦里似乎能够提高
打赏的质量…。

○合奏：与同伴合唱，同伴也会得到经验。
不需要乐器。同伴的帮助会使得演奏比普通
状态更容易成功，技能在一定程度以上的话，
打赏的质量也会上升。但是会花费很多的时
间与精力，所以和普通演奏相比会更容易浪
费时间，速度不快就很难得到分数。

○传教：通过热情的演讲和巧妙辞藻宣讲神
的美好。也能让同伴获得经验。成功满足的
话，就能拿到很多作为布施的钱，但是拿不
到道具。如果你能让异教徒顺利皈依，好像
会让人更加满意。

○魅惑之舞：比演奏更短时间，满足观众更
简单，适合得分的技巧。只要有魅力就很容
易成功，问题是大家都会看得恍惚，拿不到
什么打赏。
 
○喷火杂耍：燃烧起来了。明明忍着被烫伤
一直努力地练习了，却没有人表扬我…。

　虽然想成为一流的艺人能给大家带来满足
与笑容，但是我失败了，还被扔了石头，已
经有点心累了。
　最近妈妈也总是叫我回老家…。

What's in a performance?
	by a nameless travelling performer

I'm going to jot down a couple of 
ways of completing Performing 
quests in here just so that I don't 
forget. I've heard people say that 
all you need to do is to keep 
performing to a person until he's 
satisfied or bored, but I'm just 
not Speedy enough for that. So.

PERFORMING: perform with an 
instrument of your choice. You 
might find one at the event grounds, 
but it might not be in the right 
place so it's best to bring one 
yourself. What instrument you use 
may determine whether patrons are 
satisfied with your Performance or 
not. If they are, they will 
shower you with gold and items. 
I've also heard fables of the 
legendary Stradivarius improving
the quality of items thrown at 
you...

ENSEMBLE: sing with your pets. 
It'll be good experience for them, 
and you don't need an instrument 
either. It's a group effort so it's 
easier to succeed than a regular 
solo Performance, and if you're 
skilled enough the items thrown 
will be of better quality too. But 
doing this takes quite a bit of 
time and stamina, so be sure not 
to waste an ensemble on a deserted 
area. It also means you won't score 
as many Points with the client if 
you're not quick enough.

PREACHING: spread the Word about 
your God and captivate people with 
a gilded tongue. Pets seem to gain 
experience from this. If people are 
satisfied with your preaching, 
they'll give you quite a fair amount 
of alms. Meaning gold. No items 
though. If you're so convincing 
that people convert to your faith, 
then those people are going to be 
even more satisfied.

FASCINATION DANCE: this one's 
quicker than Performing and 
satisfies people more easily, so 
it's great for scoring Points with 
the client. If you're Charismatic, 
then all the better. There's just 
a bit of a problem with this - 
people become too transfixed on
your gyrating hips to give you 
any money.

FIRE BREATHING: did the best I 
could while on fire, but nobody 
even bat an eye...

It's my dream to become a great 
performer and bring smiles to 
people's faces wherever I go, but 
so far it's only been bringing 
rocks. Thrown in my direction. And 
Mum's been telling me to come 
home...

次元间力观测实验报告书
	written by 开发主任『加伯拉』

　次元间力是人或物超越次元的作用力。其
存在很久以前就被人注意到了。但没有具体
的观测成功例，一直被当作架空的学说对待。

　为了确认「因次元之壁阻碍了次元间力，
所以用机器很难观测到」这个假说，这次使
用了次元歪曲装置来除去次元境界面的影响
。进行了威尔帝・赫曼的第一实验与第二实验。
这次使用的机器记录在附加资料的表1中。










　从附加资料图1到图6来看，普通情况下次
元间力只发挥了０．００２５％的效率。
特别是在第二实验中，从与次元歪曲率成反
比来看，这和阿丽安的能量定理相符。
相同的存在之间的联系可以超越次元这一点
也并不是夸张。
　但是实验对象A与B移动至同一次元后，次
元间力就立即消失了。
关于这个现象还需要进一步的实验。

　关于能否利用这股能量，次元间的能量也
是从高能量流向低能量，所以只要连结次元
便可以获得无尽的能量。
　但是，次元间力的谜还有很多，长期榨取
能量对两个次元的影响也无法预测。就算没
有任何影响，也会有被对方视为侵略行为的
可能。

　首先，我建议要了解多次元宇宙同一存在
之间的联系是怎样的。通过研究这个机制，
这样我们就可以将次元间通信实用化。

Experimental Characterization of
	Dimensional Energy
	by Gavela et al.


Dimensional energy is a form of 
energy capable of trans-dimensional
interaction with objects, including
people. Its existence has long 
been theorized but has lacked 
definitive experimental evidence.

Here we present its 
characterization via Verde-Hermann
experiments with a novel 
dimensional warp unit. We also 
explore the potential 
ramifications and applications of
this technology.


To test Verde-Hermann's postulate
that measurement of dimensional
energy is difficult due to the
dampening of dimensional energy by
the inter-dimensional barrier, we 
perturbed the barrier with a
dimensional warp unit and 
conducted the first and second 
Verde-Hermann tests. The
observational unit used is 
outlined in Appendix 1.

From the data (Appendices 1 to 6),
we have determined that 
dimensional energy is weakened
by a factor of approximately 
0.0025% under normal circumstances.


In the second test, we determined
at a high confidence level that it
is likely that dimensional
energy strength is inversely 
proportional to dimensional 
warpage, conforming to Ariane's 
Laws of Energy. However, we also 
find that when two analogous 
objects A and B are moved such that 
they are in the same dimension, 
rapid dissipation of dimensional
energy occurs. Further experiments
are needed to elucidate the 
mechanism for this phenomenon.

As dimensional energy flows down 
the potential gradient, we find 
find that there is the possibility
that limitless energy can be 
harnessed if dimensions can be linked.

However, we urge caution in the 
long-term harnessing of dimensional 
energy as the effects on the
affected dimensions are yet 
unknown. Furthermore, even if the
harnessing power causes no direct 
effects, it may be deemed an act 
of aggression by inhabitants in 
the other dimension.

To conclude, further research is 
needed for determining how 
analogous existences are linked in
multi-dimensional space, and to 
study the mechanism for that
linkage to develop a practical 
trans-dimensional communications 
tool.

关于委托的建议
	written by 爱担心的父亲

写给我们的好孩子
　我知道你已经准备要出门闯荡了。爸爸我
在包裹底下放了点零钱。在把钱用光之前，
去尽量完成委托，自己赚取生活费吧。
　委托的种类有很多种。




○收集物品的委托
要领是先拿到物品再接受委托。
这些物品基本上不是在野外能捡到就是在店
里能买到。如果去野外的话记得不要惹打不
过的野生动物。
○从别人手中取得物品的委托
先向守卫询问物主的位置，再去和物主交换
物品吧。
从其他渠道获得物品也没问题，去野外捡或
去商店购买就行。

○准备饭菜的委托
在为生活打拼的阶段，准备食材做好料理可
不是什么简单的事情。
记得准备好食物再接下委托。
运气好的话说不定商店里就能买到。

○收获作物的委托
野生动物会来捣乱，你要边处理动物边干活
。收获作物也能够锻炼身体。
如果得分高于委托数倍，就会得到额外报酬
，也会得到青铜币，但初期可能很难吧。
如果忘了交货箱在哪里，按*慢慢寻找吧。

○讨伐怪物的委托
你得先完成其他委托，准备好防具再来挑战。
如果带了宠物，那也给宠物装备好防具吧。
按i键就行。
不认真准备就会被杀。哪怕最简单的委托也
是如此。

○送货委托
因为要前往其他城镇，记得确保粮食和战斗
力充足，记住城镇的位置关系。
收货人的位置可以询问守卫。如果超过了时
限，就会犯占有财物罪。
○护卫委托
这个委托也要去其他城镇。护卫对象死亡就
算失败。如果护送距离很近，赌一把轻松赚
钱也不赖。

○排除落穴或地雷的委托
如果没有陷阱知识技能就会干的很累。但也
可以靠物质感知类魔法轻松完成。

○表演委托
不会演奏，传教或舞蹈的话就麻烦了。在高
等级的人面前做拙劣的表演就会被杀，就算
懂点表演，初期也先在乞丐和老人多的地方
练习吧。

　爸爸我知道的就这么多了。韦尔尼斯南面
有一个冒险课堂，赚到钱后一定要去听一听。

　另外，就算妈妈反对你饲养波球，你也不
该和妈妈吵架吧。
　如果在外面过得不顺心就回家吧，不要赌
气了。爸爸我担心你走投无路也会宁愿沦为
乞丐。外面的世界弱肉强食，你一定要保护
好自己。
　你爸爸我...还有妈妈，都希望你能幸福。

Quest Advice
	by Worried dad

Son,
    I know you've been planning to 
leave. I've managed to scrounge up 
some money - you can find it at the
bottom of your belongings. It 
should tide you over until you can 
establish an income from taking 
quests in towns.

    You should know that there are 
several types of quests though:

- Item requests
    The key to these is to have the 
item before taking on the quest. 
They often ask for stuff that can be 
found lying around in the 
wilderness or in shops.
When going out to the wilderness, 
you don't have to fight every wild 
animal you come across.

- Belongings requests
    Ask a guard where you can find 
the person who has the requested 
item. Then talk to that guy, and 
exchange some of your items for it. 
Or, you can get it from just about 
anywhere - from the wilderness or
shops - the quest giver won't know 
the difference.

- Cooked dish requests
    It's going to be hard to have 
ingredients to cook the dishes they 
want when you don't even have 
enough to eat yourself. Take on
these quests when you're not 
struggling. If you're lucky, you 
might find the ingredient you need 
in a shop in town.

- Harvesting requests
    These are filled with wild 
animals, so you'll need to be able 
to fend them off at the very least. 
These are decent for training 
because you'll be pulling up lots 
of crops from the ground.
Exceed quota by several times and 
they'll pay you more. They might 
even give you a bronze coin too.
But going over is going to be hard 
when you're just starting off.
If you forget where the delivery 
chest is, don't panic - just look 
around with the * key.
- Monster slaying requests
    Before taking these on, make 
sure you are fully equipped with
decent armour. If you have a pet, 
make sure they are equipped as well 
by handing them equipment while 
'i'nteracting with them (using the 
'i' key). If you don't, these WILL
kill you. Yes, even the easiest ones.

- Item delivery requests
    You'll need to go to another 
town to complete these. Have enough 
food and be combat ready. Know  
where you are and where you're going.
In the destination town, you can 
ask guards where the delivery 
recipient is. If you don't deliver
in time, they'll accuse you of 
pocketing the item.
- Escort requests
    This one will also need you to 
go to another town. If the escorted 
target dies, the quest is failed. 
These can be profitable if it's 
only a short jog to the destination 
and the client isn't in any sort of 
danger.

- Hole and mine removal requests
    You won't last without the 
Disarm Trap skill. Either that or 
spells or items that allow you to 
Sense or Detect Objects.

- Performing requests
    These are hard if you can't 
perform, preach, or dance. If a 
high level person sees you messing 
up, he might kill you. So even if 
you can perform, be sure to perform 
only to beggars and old people 
until you get proficient at it.




    That's about all that I know. 
There's a cram school south of Vernis
where you can attend some seminars 
to learn more, so you might want
to go there when you have some 
money to spare after finishing some
quests.

    It really didn't have to come 
to this - the quarrel with Mom 
about getting a pet putit and 
everything.

    If you don't manage, please
don't be stubborn - come home.
Given how headstrong you are,
you'd probably rather resort to 
begging on the streets, but know 
that I'm worried about you. Do be 
careful out there, and watch your 
back. There are plenty of people 
out there who thrive on preying on 
others.

    And also know that whatever
you are, I - and your mother
as well - hope that you are
happy.

Love,
your dad

垂钓入门
	written by 很会钓鱼的钓客

　钓鱼就是把握时机抓鱼！鱼无论是吃还是
贩卖都超级棒！如何，你也蠢蠢欲动了吧？
　首先你需要钓鱼技能。没有的话就去韦尔
尼斯的训练师那里学。

　学会了技能，就该去买钓竿和鱼饵了。初
期水蚤是最合适的。按B(或shift+b)安装鱼
饵。一份饵可以用15～24次。
　技能水平低的话，就算用高级鱼饵也是钓
不上鱼的。技能每升10级换高1级的鱼饵比
较好。如果你只能钓上垃圾，就是技能与鱼
饵等级不匹配了。垃圾可是没什么用处的。

　相同的鱼，根据大小价值也不同。虽然想
钓大家伙，但这就只能看运气了。鱼大约8
小时就会腐坏，立即烹饪或冷藏起来比较好
。实在没办法的话，把鱼放在水里也不会腐
坏。

　其实…钓上来的鱼是可以投喂的。我是用
合成之壶做的鱼食。喂鱼的话鱼的质量就会
变好。鱼偶尔还会吐出道具。从来没有喂过
鱼的人可能不知道这一点吧。

Fishing Introduction
	by A proud fisherman

Kill time, get fish!
Two birds, one stone!
Do I have you hooked?
If so, read on!

First you'll need the Fishing
skill. Don't have it? Learn it
from the trainer in Vernis!

Next, you'll need to buy some
fishing rod and bait. Water flea
is best for beginners. 'B'lend  
(Shift + b key) one to attach it to 
your rod. One water flea is good 
for 15-24 uses.


The pricier and better baits won't 
work if your Fishing skill isn't up 
to snuff. Generally, you can switch 
to a better bait every 10 skill 
levels. If all you're reeling in is 
junk, that means you don't have 
enough skill to use that bait yet. 
And junk is... junk! There's no use 
for it.

As for the fish - the amount 
they'll fetch when sold depends on
their size and weight. There's no 
choosing the size of fish that bite 
though. It's all up to Lady Ehekatl!

Fish will also go bad in about
8 hours, so you'll want to cook 
them and cook often. Or you can 
carry them around in a cooler box. 
If you've got more fish than you 
can carry (wow!), pop them in a 
puddle on the ground. They won't go 
bad that way, ever!

Speaking of those fish in a puddle...
you can do some tricks with them.
I like to give mine ground bait, 
crafted in a fusion pot. Fish will 
grow in quality when you do, and
they might even spit out a useful 
item or two for you! If you're the 
sort who never feeds their fishies, 
you're missing out!

矫正收容者的指南
	written by 前辈管理员

　恭喜收容所管理官出道！从现在开始，不断
把出色的孩子被关在笼子里运送到收容所吧！
　在收容所变得坦率的孩子，无论多么讨厌你
也只能服从你了。可以作为玩赏用的收藏，成
为伙伴也可以哦。

　诶？如果只是做朋友的话就不用费事了吗？
去买奴隶？因为有支配的魔法所以不需要？
　你真是不懂啊。从一开始就顺从的孩子和用
用魔法让它顺从的孩子不一样哦。这世上可是
有让惹人厌的孩子无法逃避地劳动才能得到的
能量！

　好了，先用一下面板吧？

　把抓来的孩子从笼子里带出来之后，设定劳
动强度后让他们劳动！反正谁也跑不掉的，
所以放置3天后再来看看就好了。
　设定劳动强度越高，劳动能量就积攒的越多。
但是越高就越消耗生命力。不过死了人的话，
别忘记补充新的孩子哦？

　收容所内的物品对获得能量没有有特别的影
响，所以布局按你喜欢的来就好。
　还有…越是坦率的好孩子就越能热心的劳动
会产生很多劳动能量哦。
　矫正成坦率的孩子非常简单！只需要处死几
个人以儆效尤！包括用来处刑的孩子，凑齐人
头会变得很轻松吧。

　如何、要试试吗？那么，把坏孩子都进行矫
正吧？

Inmate Correction Manual
Written by You May Address Me As Sir

Congratulations on your new
internment camp!

But before you start filling it 
up, let's go over what it can do. 
The ones that have been...
conditioned at the camp will do 
your bidding no matter how much 
they hate your guts. At this 
point you may add them to your 
collection of playthings or have 
them fight for you in battle.

What's that you say? If you want 
a pet just buy a slave? Just 
cast dominate? Oh no no no no 
you don't get it do you?

They're different when you catch 
them like this. They're not like 
the ones that were broken with 
magic or broken to begin with.

They're feisty and fresh. The 
OTHER thing your camp can do is 
put them to work and harness 
that energy.

Now. Try using your house board.

Take one of them out of its 
cage, set a toil level, and 
watch it go!
Don't worry, it won't be going 
anywhere, so you can kick back, 
relax, and check back in about
3 days.

The higher the toil level, the 
more toil energy you get. But! 
It will also expend more of its 
life doing the tasks given, so 
don't forget to replenish the 
dead ones mmmmkay?

The interior design of the camp
won't affect how much energy you 
get. Open concept minimalistic 
camp? Marvelous. Old-fashioned 
and homey gulag? Go for it.
The sky's the limit.

And lastly, the ones that have 
become more submissive to you 
yield more toil energy.



But Sir, you may ask, how did 
you do it? How do you get them 
to stop being rebellious?
Why, the answer is simple.
Just kill some of them. The 
remaining ones will fall in 
line. Works every time.

Just remember. If you're 
earmarking some for killing,
don't forget to grab a few more 
the next time you replenish your 
stock.

Easy, right? Now get going, chop 
chop. These naughty things 
aren't going to discipline
themselves.
