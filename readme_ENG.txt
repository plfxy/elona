1.Introduction
Elona is a freeware RPG. I hope you enjoy it.


2.The opening scene

	The scene is written by Sunstrike
	The one in the game is cut short, this is his
	original work and more detailed one.

Ages ago, in the times when the scars of Rehm-Ido still
marred the land of Irva, the 11th era of Sierre Terre began. 

In those days the land of Irva was still plagued by
destruction and war and though prophesized as the beginnings
of peace, Sierre Terre brought chaos as well as hope.

It rained nonstop for over a month, and when the torrents
finally subsided the forests surrounding the region of Karune
slowly transformed into an inhospitable blight. Strange fogs
oozed forth from the forest and the creatures grow violent and mad.

The Elean forest grow with frightening speed, and though it
originated in Vindale, it rapidly began to consume the whole of
Karune. As the forest devoured the land, it drove countless
refugees into the western reaches of the continent.

But then, not so long ago, Saimore, prince of the Western
Empire of Zanan, issued a proclamation blaming the destruction
of the world and the end of Rehm-Ido on the forests.  He claimed
that the Eleas, who were mysteriously immune to the effects of
the ether being emitted by the forests, were in fact responsible
for spreading the blight and inciting the monstrous growth of the
forests.  His orders demanded the annihilation of the Eleas and
subsequently, the obliteration of the Vindale forests.
 
In short order, the violence grew.  Suspicion and mistrust
infected the hearts of the people.  Many of the Eleas, fearing
persecution, fled deep into the Vindale.  More still fled to other
lands, others began to fight back.  Now, the conflict grows worse
with each passing day and a final confrontation becomes more and
more inevitable.

A war of genocide could erupt at any time...

The night has almost passed. You have stowed away aboard the
Queen Sedona, one of the last ships to leave for North Tyris.
It is her maiden voyage, and she is bound for Port Kapul.

Suddenly, you are awakened by the sound of sky-shattering
thunder. Heavy winds pitch the seas into disarray and the ship
wails in agony as increasingly violent waves slam into her bow.

A gust of fierce, dry wind buffets the ship. A faint blue light
creeps across the night skies and wisp-like tendrils of shimmering 
air begin to sweep over the oceans. An old sailor mutters a faint
curse under his breath.

"The ether wind descends upon us..."

The ship roars in misery as the very planks holding her together
are eaten away by the ether's light. Then... without so much as
a moment's warning, the hull and all the ships passengers are swept
into the oceans.

You feel a surge of wild emotion in your heart as you are pulled
beneath the waves by powerful tides. The last thing you remember
as the Queen Sedona is swallowed into the depths of the sea, is the
mysterious dancing light of the ether winds drifting away from you
as sink into the depths...

Game Info:
In the summer 2006, development of Elona has begun.
The game is inspired by many great games like ADOM and Angband.
In short, it's a rogue-like game but my goal is to make a life sim
game in a funny world. Randomness, humor, persistence are some of
the main elements of the game.
